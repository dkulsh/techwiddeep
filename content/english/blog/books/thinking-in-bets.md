# Thinking in Bets: A Review

This book explores decision-making through a unique lens, drawing from Annie Duke’s experience as a poker world champion. In poker, every decision has immediate monetary consequences, offering a powerful perspective on choices—beyond just winning or losing millions. Let’s dive into the book’s core insights!

#### Separate Results from Decisions

> **Idea**: *Results don’t always reflect the quality of your decisions.*

Let’s start with a key principle: we often wrongly tie outcomes to decision quality. I loved this concept.

- Driving drunk and reaching home safely doesn’t mean drunk driving is a good idea. You might just be *lucky*.
- Driving sober and getting into an accident doesn’t mean sobriety was a bad choice. You might be *unlucky*.

This resonates in tech environments:

- At IT companies, overtime may yield results, but that doesn’t mean it’s a good idea—it’s often counterproductive, leading to burnout and poor code quality.
- Conversely, avoiding overtime and missing a deadline doesn’t mean the decision was wrong.

> *Decisions and results aren’t tightly coupled.*

This understanding sets the stage for handling uncertainty in decision-making.

#### Embrace the Unknown

> **Idea**: *Accepting uncertainty is crucial for better decisions.*

The future is unpredictable, and our biases—blind spots, motivated reasoning, outcome bias, and luck—cloud our judgment.

We try to map decisions to an unknown future, but our weaknesses lead to poor analysis of both the future and the past. Annie Duke emphasizes that failure is inevitable and acceptable. Even with great poker cards, luck can favor your opponent. Lick your wounds and move on!

> *The future is unknown, and embracing it as such strengthens decision-making.*

With this mindset, let’s explore what stood out in the book.

#### What Stood Out

> **Principle**: Practical strategies make decision-making actionable.

Unlike books that merely advocate better decisions, *Thinking in Bets* offers *practical steps*. Here’s what I loved:

- **Decision Swear Jar**:
  - Avoid absolutes like “100% confident,” “someone is wrong,” or “bad luck.”
  - Correcting verbal habits builds awareness for better choices.

- **Betting for Clarity**:

  - Bet money on your beliefs (e.g., “I’m good at my job—$500?”). Fear of loss opens your mind to others’ viewpoints.

- **Give Credit, Accept Mistakes**:
  - When others are promoted, recognize their energy, accountability, or assertiveness—not just luck.
  - When promoted, reflect on what could be improved, acknowledging luck’s role.

- **Hide Results When Seeking Opinions**:
  - Asking, “Should I study Android?” without mentioning “I applied to 50 jobs and got no replies” prevents biased advice. Results skew perspectives.

- **Decision Review Group**:
  - Like code reviews in IT, form a group to critique life decisions, fostering improvement.

These strategies provide a roadmap for better choices, but the book has flaws.

#### Final Thoughts

The book can feel verbose, repeating themes of uncertainty and decision-making. As a poker player, not a writer, Annie Duke’s prose lacks the magnetic pull of books like *The Power of Habit* by Charles Duhigg, which turns a dry topic into a captivating narrative.

Still, I’m glad I read *Thinking in Bets*. It didn’t ignite a burning need to improve my decisions but offered *practical steps* to make better choices and avoid lamenting failures as mere skill gaps. Life is a long poker game—better decisions win most hands, but sometimes, it’s just *bad luck*.

That’s *Thinking in Bets*! Explore more book reviews in our [Books category](#) to continue your journey of growth. Share your feedback, like, comment, or reach out!
