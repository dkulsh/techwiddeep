This book explores decision-making through a unique lens, drawing from Annie Duke’s experience as a poker world champion. In poker, every decision has immediate monetary consequences, offering a powerful perspective on choices—beyond just winning or losing millions. Let’s dive into the book’s core insights!

#### Separate Results from Decisions

Let’s start with a key principle: we often wrongly tie outcomes to decision quality. I loved this concept.

> *Results don’t always reflect the quality of your decisions.*

Consider these:
- Driving drunk but arriving safely doesn’t mean it was a good call. You got *lucky*.
- Driving sober but crashing doesn’t mean it was a bad call. You might’ve been *unlucky*.

This resonates in tech environments:

- At IT companies, **Overtime produces `code`**, but that doesn’t mean it’s a good idea—it’s often counterproductive, leading to burnout and poor code quality.
- Conversely, **No overtime, no results** doesn’t mean the decision was wrong. Other factors may be at play.


Ever judged a decision by its outcome? Annie Duke calls this “resulting”—tying decisions too tightly to results. This understanding sets the stage for handling uncertainty in decision-making.

Good decisions can lead to bad outcomes, and bad decisions can luck out. Focus on the process, not the result.

#### Embrace the Unknown

The future is unpredictable, and our biases—blind spots, motivated reasoning, outcome bias, and luck—cloud our judgment.

> *Accepting uncertainty is crucial for better decisions.*

We try to map decisions to an unknown future, but our weaknesses lead to poor analysis of both the future and the past. Annie Duke emphasizes that failure is inevitable and acceptable. Even with great poker cards, luck can favor your opponent. 

Lick your wounds and move on!

#### What Stood Out

Unlike books that merely advocate better decisions, *Thinking in Bets* offers *practical steps*. Here’s what I loved:

- **Decision Swear Jar**:
  - “I’m 100% sure.”
  - “They’re wrong.”
  - “It’s just bad luck.”

  > Most things aren’t absolutes—our words should reflect that.

  Correcting absolute language (like a swear jar) builds better decision habits. Try it next time you’re debugging a tricky `bug`!

- **Betting for Clarity**:
  
  How much would you bet you’re great at your job? $500? $10,000? A million? The fear of losing cash opens your mind to others’ views. *What belief would you bet on today?*

  > Betting forces you to face reality.

- **Give Credit, Accept Mistakes**:
  - When others are promoted, recognize their energy, accountability, or assertiveness—not just luck.
  - When promoted, reflect on what could be improved, acknowledging luck’s role.

- **Hide Results When Seeking Opinions**:

  Don’t share outcomes when asking for advice. Example:
  - Asking, “Should I study `Android`?” gets open feedback.
  - Saying, “I applied to 50 `Android` jobs and got no calls,” biases the response.

  > Hide the result to get honest input.


- **Decision Review Group**:
  - Think `code review` but for life’s choices. Surround yourself with people who challenge your decisions, like a peer review for a `pull request`.

#### Final Thoughts

The book can feel verbose, repeating themes of uncertainty and decision-making. As a poker player, not a writer, Annie Duke’s prose lacks the magnetic pull of books like *The Power of Habit* by Charles Duhigg, which turns a dry topic into a captivating narrative.

It didn’t make me crave better decisions, but it gave me tools to get there—and to accept failures as part luck, not just skill. Life’s a long poker game: better decisions win more hands, but sometimes, bad luck strikes.
