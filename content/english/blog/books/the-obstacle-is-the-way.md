The book discusses a stoic philosophy - *obstacles exist to make us better*.

I loved this book and have pencil marks all over it.

Problems are like video game levels. Each requires practice, creativity, persistence, or teamwork to overcome. In that sense, every problem is an opportunity to become better:

- A more creative person
- More hardworking
- More resourceful
- A better team player

Let's explore some inspiring stories from the book that illustrate this philosophy.

#### Rockefeller

##### Obstacle Is the Way

John D. Rockefeller used the Great Depression as a learning tool. He overcame this challenge to become one of the richest men in the world.

Was he born this way? No, this was learned behavior.

While many others experienced the same problems as Rockefeller did, few reacted as he did.

Not many trained themselves to see the opportunity inside the obstacle. *People saw the bad economy and not the learning opportunity*.

The obstacle (economic depression) gave way to Rockefeller.

This mindset applies to our professional lives as well.

*As a software engineer:*

- *Not getting enough interview calls?*
  - Maybe the resume needs to be polished
  - More applications
  - Better-suited profiles

- *Not getting a salary hike?*
  - Maybe we need to sell ourselves better
  - Maybe it's time to upskill
  - *Maybe we need to start a company and not work at a job anymore*

As you see, solving each problem helps us move to the "next level" in our lives.

Building on this idea of turning obstacles into opportunities, consider the story of a famous general.

#### Ulysses S. Grant

##### Steady Nerves

General Grant once sat for a photoshoot. The studio was dark, so the photographer sent an assistant up to the roof to uncover the skylight.

The assistant shattered the window, sending shards of glass from the roof like knives.

The horrified photographer saw Grant look up to see the hole. Then he looked back at the camera as if nothing had happened.

*General Grant had mastered steadying his nerves.* No wonder he won the war for the Union.

These lessons extend to everyday challenges in the workplace.

- The manager has been unfair?
- Subordinate did not deliver code?
- Did the client change the requirements?

*Does getting upset provide you with more options?*

Shifting perspective can reveal hidden opportunities, as shown in this wartime example.

#### Blitzkrieg

##### Flip to See the Opportunity

The term Blitzkrieg means lightning war. During World War II, Germans used the tactic as an offensive that caught the enemy unprepared.

After Allied General Dwight Eisenhower ordered looking at Blitzkrieg as an opportunity, *the Allied forces trapped Germans into what was called a "meat grinder"*.

Even small setbacks can be reframed positively.

Did not save the document? You will have to do it again üòûüòîüò£

- You will be twice as good üòèüòäüòÄüòÉ

Rival at work?

- He keeps you alert and hardens you
- Raises the stakes

End of your rope?

- You can experiment with the silliest approaches

Flip and see the opportunity.

Persistence starts with small steps, as demonstrated by this meteorology pioneer.

#### Espy

##### 25 More to Go

James Pollard Espy was a great nineteenth-century pioneer of meteorology. *He did not read or write until age eighteen*.

On a chance encounter with orator Henry Clay, his friend shouted for him, "He wants to be like you, even though he can't read."

Clay grabbed one of his posters, with the word CLAY on it. He said, "You see that, boy?"

Pointing to a letter: "That's an A. Now, you've only got twenty-five more letters to go."

*(Mental level of difficulty cleared) Within one year, Espy started college.*

We often get bogged down by overthinking instead of acting.

We dive endlessly into:

- What things "mean"
- Whether it is "fair"
- What is "behind" this

Then we wonder why we don't have the energy to actually deal with our problems üòÅüòÑüòÉüòÇ

If we had just got to work, we'd probably be done already!

Creative solutions can bypass traditional barriers, as seen in this business rivalry.

#### What Works Is Right

##### Buy 'Em Out

In 1915, two American fruit companies fought for a piece of disputed land. This was at the border of Honduras and Guatemala.

The bigger company, United Fruit, dispatched an army of lawyers to both countries. The lawyers worked to find every piece of legal paper and fight at the highest levels in the courts.

*The smaller company simply bought the land from all owners!*

They cleared the level with a creative solution.

This approach raises questions about ethics and effectiveness.

I know a few successful individuals that got 'creative' with parts of their resume.

Right or wrong?

The question is: Did it work?

Inner strength is built through deliberate effort, much like this president's journey.

#### Roosevelt

##### Inner Fort

The macho US president Theodore Roosevelt spent his early years struggling with asthma.

Until his father came to his room and said, "Theodore, you have the mind but you haven't got the body. I am giving you the tools to make your body. It's going to be hard drudgery and I think you have the determination to go through with it."

Exercising hours each day for years, *Roosevelt worked the weakness out of his body*.

With hard work, he cleared the level and went on to become the president.

We must fortify our own resilience to face life's challenges.

Each one of us knows our inner fort. We also know the time the fort was breached.

Build and strengthen it. *Sooner or later, life will invade.*

Ben Franklin said, "The things that hurt, instruct."

In other words, clear the level!
