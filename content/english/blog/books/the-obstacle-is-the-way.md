**Turn obstacles into opportunities.**

*The Obstacle is the Way* by Ryan Holiday champions a Stoic philosophy: **Obstacles exist to make us better.** This book is a gem—my copy is covered in pencil marks from cover to cover.

> Problems are like video game levels: Each requires practice, creativity, persistence, or teamwork to conquer.

Every challenge is a chance to grow into:
- A more **creative** person
- A **harder worker**
- A more **resourceful** thinker
- A better **team player**

Here are the stories and ideas that stuck with me, reimagined for techies:

---

#### Rockefeller’s Lesson

> Obstacles offer growth opportunities.

John D. Rockefeller didn’t just survive the Great Depression—he used it to become one of the world’s richest men. Was he born a genius? No. He **trained** himself to see opportunities where others saw only obstacles.

Many faced the same crisis, but few responded like him. He saw opportunity in adversity. **Others saw economic ruin, not learning potential.**

**As a software engineer, sound familiar?**
- Not getting enough **interview calls**? Polish your `resume`, apply to more roles, or target better-suited positions.
- Stuck without a **salary hike**? Sell your value better, upskill, or—boldly—start your own company.

Solving problems advances us to the “next level.”

#### Ulysses S. Grant’s Composure

**Master steady nerves amid chaos.**

General Grant sat for a photoshoot in a dark studio. An assistant shattered the skylight, raining glass like knives.

Horrified, the photographer watched Grant glance up, then resume posing unfazed.

*Grant mastered steadying his nerves.* No wonder he won the Civil War.

These lessons extend to workplace challenges:

- Unfair manager? Don’t lose your cool.
- Subordinate didn’t deliver `code`? Stay focused.
- Client changed requirements? Adapt.

Does getting upset give you more options? Keep calm and move on.

#### Blitzkrieg’s Reversal

**Flip obstacles to uncover advantages.**

Blitzkrieg (“lightning war”) was Germany’s WWII offensive, catching enemies off-guard.

Allied General Dwight Eisenhower reframed it as opportunity, trapping Germans in a “meat grinder.”

Even minor setbacks flip positively:

- Lost a document? 😞 Rewrite it—you’ll be **twice as skilled**. 😃  
- Rival at work? They keep you sharp and raise the stakes.  
- At the end of your rope? Experiment with bold, creative solutions.

#### Espy’s Breakthrough

**Break big challenges into steps.**

James Pollard Espy, a meteorology pioneer, couldn’t read or write until 18. When a friend shouted to orator Henry Clay, “He wants to be like you, but he can’t read,” Clay pointed to a poster: “That’s an A. You’ve only got 25 more letters to go.” **Within a year, Espy was in college**.

We bog down overthinking instead of acting—diving into “meaning,” “fairness,” “motives.” Then wonder why no energy for problems 😁😄😃😂.

**Stop overthinking—get to work, and you’ll be done already!**


---

#### Creative Buyout

**Innovation trumps convention.**

In 1915, two fruit companies battled over disputed land between Honduras and Guatemala. United Fruit sent lawyers to litigate in courts.

**The smaller company bought the land from all owners!**

Creative solution cleared the level. Right or wrong? Did it work?


---

#### Roosevelt’s Fortitude

**Build resilience through effort.**

Young Theodore Roosevelt battled asthma until his father said: “Theodore, you have the mind but not the body. I’m giving tools to build it. It’ll be hard, but you’ve the determination.”

Exercising daily for years, *Roosevelt eradicated his weakness*.

Hard work cleared the level. He later became president.

We must fortify resilience—life will test it.

Each knows their inner fort and breaches. Strengthen it. **Life invades eventually.**

Ben Franklin said, **“The things that hurt, instruct.”** In tech and in life, obstacles aren’t roadblocks—they’re levels to clear.

> The obstacle *is* the way.

This book is a roadmap for turning setbacks into growth. What obstacle are you facing right now?
