# The Obstacle Is the Way: A Review

![Cover Image](/images/books/the-obstacle-is-the-way/the-obstacle-is-the-way-cover.jpeg)

Ryan Holiday’s *The Obstacle Is the Way* champions stoic philosophy: *obstacles exist to make us better*. I loved this book, with pencil marks throughout.

Problems resemble video game levels—each demands practice, creativity, persistence, or teamwork. Every obstacle hones us into:

- More creative individuals.
- Harder workers.
- Better resource users.
- Stronger team players.

Let’s explore inspiring stories illustrating this philosophy.

---

#### Rockefeller’s Lesson

> **Idea**: *Obstacles offer growth opportunities.*

John D. Rockefeller turned the Great Depression into a lesson, becoming one of history’s wealthiest.

Born this way? No—learned.

Many faced the same crisis, but few responded like him. He saw opportunity in adversity. *Others saw economic ruin, not learning potential.*

The obstacle yielded to Rockefeller.

This mindset applies professionally.

As a software engineer:

- *Few interview calls?* Polish your resume, apply more, target better fits.
- *No raise?* Sell yourself better, upskill, or start your own venture.

Solving problems advances us to the “next level.”

Building on turning obstacles into opportunities, consider a famous general’s story.

---

#### Ulysses S. Grant’s Composure

> **Idea**: *Master steady nerves amid chaos.*

General Grant sat for a photoshoot in a dark studio. An assistant shattered the skylight, raining glass like knives.

Horrified, the photographer watched Grant glance up, then resume posing unfazed.

*Grant mastered steadying his nerves.* No wonder he won the Civil War.

These lessons extend to workplace challenges:

- Unfair manager?
- Undelivered code?
- Changed requirements?

*Does upset expand options?*

Shifting perspective reveals hidden opportunities, as in this wartime tactic.

---

#### Blitzkrieg’s Reversal

> **Idea**: *Flip obstacles to uncover advantages.*

Blitzkrieg (“lightning war”) was Germany’s WWII offensive, catching enemies off-guard.

Allied General Dwight Eisenhower reframed it as opportunity, trapping Germans in a “meat grinder.”

Even minor setbacks flip positively:

- Didn’t save the document? Redo it 😞😔😣—*twice as good* 😏😊😀😃.
- Workplace rival? Sharpens you, raises stakes.
- At rope’s end? Experiment wildly.

Flip to see opportunity.

Persistence starts small, as this pioneer shows.

#### Espy’s Breakthrough

> **Idea**: *Break big challenges into steps.*

Nineteenth-century meteorology pioneer James Pollard Espy couldn’t read or write until 18.

Inspired by orator Henry Clay, his friend shouted, “He wants to be like you, even though he can’t read.”

Clay pointed to his poster’s “CLAY”: “See that, boy? That’s an A. You’ve only 25 more letters to go.”

*Mental barrier cleared—Espy started college within a year.*

We bog down overthinking instead of acting—diving into “meaning,” “fairness,” “motives.” Then wonder why no energy for problems 😁😄😃😂.

Just work—we’d be done!

Creative solutions bypass barriers, as in this rivalry.

---

#### Creative Buyout

> **Idea**: *Innovation trumps convention.*

In 1915, two fruit companies disputed Honduras-Guatemala border land.

United Fruit sent lawyers to litigate in courts.

*The smaller company bought the land from all owners!*

Creative solution cleared the level.

This raises ethics vs. effectiveness.

Some “creatively” enhance resumes. Right or wrong? Did it work?

Inner strength builds deliberately, like this president’s.

---

#### Roosevelt’s Fortitude

> **Idea**: *Build resilience through effort.*

Young Theodore Roosevelt battled asthma until his father said: “Theodore, you have the mind but not the body. I’m giving tools to build it. It’ll be hard, but you’ve the determination.”

Exercising daily for years, *Roosevelt eradicated his weakness*.

Hard work cleared the level—he became president.

We must fortify resilience—life will test it.

Each knows their inner fort and breaches. Strengthen it. *Life invades eventually.*

---

Ben Franklin said, “The things that hurt, instruct.”

In other words, clear the level!
