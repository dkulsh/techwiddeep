#### Introduction

Ask interviewers why they selected one candidate over another. They’ll cite qualifications, experience, and required skills. But research reveals they’re often misled by a subtle force.

Data shows one key factor dominates: 
{{< bigtext class="big-bold-text" >}}Did the candidate seem pleasant ?{{< /bigtext >}}

- Those who smiled and maintained eye contact.
- Who discussed topics of interest to the interviewer, even off-topic.

  *A coffee comment sparked a 15-minute chat about the interviewer’s passion and $2,000 coffee machine. Job offered.*

- Who genuinely praised the organization. Keyword: **genuinely**.

>In essence, likability trumps credentials.

**PS**: Ass-kissing differs from being pleasant.

These insights highlight the power of likability in interviews.

#### How about black-spots ??

What if one has some weak areas ? lack of experience, unimpressive performance or less than stellar credentials ?

Again, data shows that - people who present their weaknesses in the beginning do better. Admitting weakness is seen as a sign of openness.

>Admitting flaws shows character and integrity, implying no intent to deceive.

Think about it for a second. **A person who admits his failures would have the *strength of character* and *integrity*.  Therefore, the person would **NOT** intend to mislead us.**


For an interview, I completely forgot about the schedule. And was working on something else. Later (having kicked myself on the bum) I wrote back the following:

*I just realized that we had a discussion today. Was in a production issue, and completely forgot about this conversation. Lost track of my time ..*  
*This is completely my fault. And I apologize.*   
*Would we be able to reschedule this to another day ? If so, I'll be grateful. If not, I understand. Thanks.*

The interview was re-conducted.

Admitting one’s weakness, a person becomes likable. But again, openness or pleasantness have their limits. ( *I wrote the mail back in within the hour, not after a week* )

Building on the idea of openness, let’s discuss how to present your strengths effectively.

#### Sharing Achievements

Have you ever been in an interview where a candidate jumped straight into bragging about their achievements? I’ve seen it many times—it's kinda a showoff.

Again we have studies. A person is more likable when they mention their accomplishment towards the end.

>If strengths emerge naturally, you appear humble.


Think about it - **if someone mentions their strengths too soon, then they seem boastful. However, if they let their strengths emerge naturally, they are seen as modest**.

Kids - wait to let the person know that you single-handedly saved the day.

#### Managing Mistakes

So, you’ve been pleasant, open, and modest. But what if you blank on binary search time complexity?

Again we have data. We **overestimate** the impact of a mistake.

Meaning, our mistakes seem bigger to us than they really are. This is also called the *Spotlight effect* in psychology—the tendency to believe others notice our flaws more than they actually do.

**Overreacting draws attention. Acknowledge if needed, and move on as if it wasn’t a big deal.**

To tie everything together, here are the key elements for a successful interview.

#### Final Thoughts

These elements define a great interview. Likability outweighs achievements and experience. So:

- Groom well—wear a collared shirt, shave.
- Listen sincerely—ask questions based on what you hear, repeat key points to show engagement.
- Offer genuine compliments.
- Discuss non-work topics.
- Smile and maintain eye contact.

Don’t hide weaknesses. Instead, bring them out in the beginning. This will give you a credibility boost.

{{< bigtext class="big-text-block">}}
Wait to share achievements. This lets the interviewer know that you are modest.

{{< bigtext class="big-text-block">}}
If you make a mistake. Don't overreact. Acknowledge if appropriate, then move ahead.
