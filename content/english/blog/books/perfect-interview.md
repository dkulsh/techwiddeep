#### Introduction

Ask interviewers why they selected one candidate over another. They’ll cite qualifications, experience, and required skills. But research reveals they’re often misled by a subtle force.

Data shows one key factor dominates: *Did the candidate seem pleasant?*

- Those who smiled and maintained eye contact.
- Who discussed topics of interest to the interviewer, even off-topic.

*A coffee comment sparked a 15-minute chat about the interviewer’s passion and $2,000 coffee machine. Job offered.*

- Who genuinely praised the organization. *Keyword: genuinely*.

In essence, likability trumps credentials. PS: Ass-kissing differs from being pleasant.

These insights highlight the power of likability in interviews. Now, let’s explore how to handle potential weaknesses.

#### Handling Weaknesses

What about gaps like inexperience or underwhelming credentials? Data favors those who disclose weaknesses early—it signals openness.

Admitting flaws shows character and integrity, implying no intent to deceive.

In one interview, I forgot the schedule while fixing a production issue. I emailed promptly:

> “I just realized we had a discussion today. I was deep in a production issue and lost track of time. This is entirely my fault—I apologize. Could we reschedule? If not, I understand. Thanks.”

The interview was rescheduled. Openness builds credibility, but within limits (e.g., respond quickly).

Building on the idea of openness, let’s discuss how to present your strengths effectively.

#### Sharing Achievements

I’ve seen candidates boast early—it comes off as arrogant. Studies show revealing accomplishments later enhances likability, portraying modesty.

If strengths emerge naturally, you appear humble.

After addressing strengths and weaknesses, it’s important to consider how to handle mistakes during the interview.

#### Managing Mistakes

So, you’ve been pleasant, open, and modest. But what if you blank on binary search time complexity?

Data reveals we *overestimate* mistakes’ impact—the “spotlight effect.”

Overreacting draws attention. Acknowledge if needed, then proceed calmly.

To tie everything together, here are the key elements for a successful interview.

#### Final Thoughts

These elements define a great interview. Likability outweighs achievements and experience. So:

- Groom well—wear a collared shirt, shave.
- Listen sincerely—ask questions based on what you hear, repeat key points to show engagement.
- Offer genuine compliments.
- Discuss non-work topics.
- Smile and maintain eye contact.

Don’t hide weaknesses—reveal them early for a credibility boost.

Delay sharing achievements to demonstrate modesty.

If you err, don’t overreact—acknowledge and move on.
