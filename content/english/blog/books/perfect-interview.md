#### Introduction

Ask any interviewer why they chose one candidate over the other. They will tell you about qualifications and experience. They will also have a list of skills needed for the job.

But research shows interviewers are deluding themselves. They are swayed by a mysterious and powerful force.

Data shows that only one important factor plays a role:

*Did the candidate appear to be a pleasant person?*

- Folks who made an effort to smile and maintain eye contact.
- Who talked about topics not exactly related to the discussion but of interest to the interviewer.

*A comment about coffee turned into a 15-minute chat. Like, how the interviewer was a coffee aficionado and had a 2 lakh rupee coffee machine at his house.*

*Job was offered to me.*

- Who sincerely tried to praise the organization. Keyword - *sincerely*.

In other words, a pleasant person.

Studies demonstrate that going out of one's way to be pleasant is way more important than qualifications and work experience.

PS: Ass-kissing is different from being pleasant.

These insights highlight the power of likability in interviews. Now, let's explore how to handle potential weaknesses.

#### How About Black Spots?

What if one has some weak areas, such as lack of experience, unimpressive performance, or less than stellar credentials?

Again, data shows that people who present their weaknesses in the beginning do better. Admitting weakness is seen as a sign of openness.

Think about it for a second. A person who admits his failures would have the strength of character and integrity. Therefore, the person would not intend to mislead us.

For an interview, I completely forgot about the schedule and was working on something else. Later, having kicked myself, I wrote back the following:

The interview was re-conducted.

"I just realized that we had a discussion today. Was in a production issue, and completely forgot about this conversation. Lost track of my time."

"This is completely my fault, and I apologize."

"Would we be able to reschedule this to another day? If so, I'll be grateful. If not, I understand. Thanks."

Admitting one's weakness makes a person likable. But again, openness or pleasantness have their limits. (I wrote the email back within the hour, not after a week.)

Building on the idea of openness, let's discuss how to present your strengths effectively.

#### Glories and Victories

I've been in many interviews where the candidate opened up with their glorification. It's kind of a showoff.

Again, we have studies. A person is more likable when they mention their accomplishment toward the end.

Think about it: If someone mentions their strengths too soon, then they seem boastful. However, if they let their strengths emerge naturally, they are seen as modest.

Kids, wait to let the person know that you single-handedly saved the day.

After addressing strengths and weaknesses, it's important to consider how to handle mistakes during the interview.

#### Blunders

So, we've been pleasant, open, and modest. But what if I forgot the time complexity of binary search or something similarly silly?

Again, we have data. We *overestimate* the impact of a mistake.

Meaning, our mistakes seem bigger to us than they really are. This is also called the "spotlight effect" in psychology.

Excessive responses might actually draw the interviewer's attention to the mistake.

So, if appropriate, then acknowledge the mistake and move on as if it wasn't a big deal.

To tie everything together, here are the key elements for a successful interview.

#### Wrap Up

These are the elements of a great interview.

Likability is more important than achievements and experience. So,

- Look smart; groom yourself well.
  - Wear a collared shirt.
  - Shave.
- Listen sincerely.
  - Ask questions based on what you hear.
  - Maybe repeat something back that the other person said. Lets them know that you were really listening.
- Give a genuine compliment.
- Talk about non-work related stuff.
- Smile and maintain eye contact.

Don't hide weaknesses.

Instead, bring them out in the beginning. This will give you a credibility boost.

Wait to share achievements.

This lets the interviewer know that you are modest.

If you make a mistake,

Don't overreact. Acknowledge if appropriate, then move ahead.
