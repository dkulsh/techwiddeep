# Ego Is the Enemy: A Review

Ryan Holiday opens *Ego Is the Enemy* by sharing his highs and lows—from book consultant and strategist, one of the US’s youngest talents, to multiple failures. Ending up in the hospital with a panic attack. Laying bare one’s failures takes courage and humility—I respect that.

Holiday attributes his blind spots to ego: “Your talent becomes your identity, and accomplishments your worth.” In tech:

My identity becomes:

- *I’m an Infoscion* (Infosys employee).
- *I’m a Googler*.
- *I’m ex-McKinsey*.

My worth? A bank balance of $20,000 or $200,000. Neither lasts forever—changes hurt.

These insights set the stage for the key ideas in the book. Here are some I loved!

---

#### Be or Do: The Choice

> **Idea**: True impact comes from action, not appearance.

John Boyd, a pivotal modern warfare strategist, remains obscure because *he was a strategist, not just appearing as one*. As Boyd said:

> “One day you’ll decide: *Be* somebody—compromise, turn your back on friends, gain club membership, promotions, assignments. Or *do something*—no promotions, no favors, but no compromises. Stay true to friends and yourself. Your work might matter.”

*Having authority differs from being the authority.*

*Having rights differs from being right.*

Today:

*Influencing differs from being an influencer.*

*Mentoring differs from being a mentor.*

*Impressing differs from being impressive.*

*To be a software engineer or to do software engineering? Which path will you choose?*

Building on this distinction, the book explores how ego permeates our lives.

---

#### Ego Is Omnipresent

Ego lurks everywhere. I’ve seen:

- Talented engineers defy bosses—fired months later.
- Bosses claim subordinates’ ideas—exposed in crises, admitting no “details” knowledge, losing credibility.

Ego has always existed, but social media—Facebook, Instagram, followers, likes—amplifies it.

In this environment, values tie to validation, ruled by emotions. Success seems talent-based, but *talent is just the start*.

Your ego asks: Will you maximize your talent? Or *be your own worst enemy?*

This dependency on validation leads to inaction.

#### Talk vs. Work

> **Idea**: Real progress demands hard, unglamorous effort.

Talk is easy—work is tough, tiring, boring.

Talk:

- Discussing blog ideas in a coffee shop.
- Reading blogs for “inspiration.”

Work:

- Alone in a room, brainstorming next ideas.
- Rereading the blog six times.
- Shifting passive to active voice.
- Adding transitions.

Talk is cheap. *Real work is hard, tiring, and boring.*

Beyond talking, pride can further hinder progress.

---

#### The Pitfalls of Pride

- *I’m a writer because I have a blog.*
- *I’m an influencer because I have followers.*
- *I’m important because 20 report to me.*

That’s pride.

Good work thrives on feedback—but pride drowns it out.

Lower pride. Amp up the work!

Success brings its own challenges, often amplified by ego.

---

#### Dangers of Success

At a mountain’s peak, air thins due to environment. At success’s peak, reality thins—stop listening, learning, forgetting basics—due to ego.

Handling success (like failure) requires effort.

*Can you handle success? Or will it ruin you?*

Unhandled success:

- Celebrity scandals with drugs, prostitutes.
- Sports stars’ lost fortunes.
- Fallen dictators, kings.

Handled success:

- Mahendra Singh Dhoni—avoids headlines for wrong reasons; joined Indian Para commandos as Lt. Colonel.
- Roger Federer—fame without scandals or multiple marriages.
- Genghis Khan—military genius, lifelong student.

As knowledge grows, ignorance’s shore expands. Humility grasps you know less amid more.

At the top—*work*. It sustains you.

To sustain success, prioritize what truly matters.

---

#### What Truly Matters?

Double salary far from home? Or less near family?

Work-from-home? Or rigid office?

Stable low-risk pay? Or startup’s high risk/reward?

Reflect on what’s essential. Without it, success won’t fulfill—or last. Worse, it won’t endure!

Especially with money: Without knowing your needs, default becomes *more*.

Energy diverts from calling to bank-filling. Without essentials, happiness eludes—regardless of job, millions, or billions.

*Not to aspire or seek from ego.*

*To succeed without ego.*

*To push through failure with strength, not ego.*

In conclusion, I liked the book (obvious by now). It’s a reference I return to often.

A good read. *Ego is the enemy.*
