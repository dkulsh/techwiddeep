Ryan Holiday opens *Ego Is the Enemy* by sharing his highs and lows—from book consultant and strategist, one of the US’s youngest talents, to multiple failures. Ending up in the hospital with a panic attack. Laying bare one’s failures takes courage and humility—I respect that.

In the tech world, ego often sneaks into our identities and self-worth. Ever catch yourself thinking:

- *I’m an `Infoscion` or a `Googler`—that’s who I am.*
- *My worth is tied to my `20 lakhs` or `2 crores` bank balance.*

{{< bigtext class="big-bold-text" >}}When your identity is your job title or your worth is your bank account, change hits hard—and it hurts. {{< /bigtext >}}

#### Be a Software Engineer, Don’t Just Look Like One

> True impact comes from action, not appearance.

John Boyd, a brilliant military strategist, stayed obscure because he prioritized *doing* over *appearing*. He once said:

One day you’ll face a choice:  
- **Be** somebody: Compromise, chase promotions, and gain favor—but lose your integrity.  
- **Do** something: Stay true to yourself, even if it means fewer titles or assignments. Your work might change the world.


*Having authority differs from BEING the authority.*

*Having rights differs from BEING right.*

Today:

*Influencing differs from being an influencer.*

*Mentoring differs from being a mentor.*

*Impressing differs from being impressive.*

So, techies: Will you *do* software engineering or just *look* like a software engineer? Which path will you choose?

#### Ego Is Omnipresent

Ego lurks everywhere. I’ve seen:

- Talented engineers snub their bosses, only to get fired months later.
- Bosses claim subordinates’ ideas. When exposed in crises, admitting no “details” knowledge, and losing credibility.

Ego has always existed, but social media—Facebook, Instagram, followers, likes—amplifies it. Platforms like `Facebook`, `Twitter`, and `LinkedIn` thrive on validation—likes, shares, followers. Growing up in this culture, we tie success to talent alone, but ego blinds us to the work needed to sustain it.

Your ego asks: Will you maximize your talent? Or *be your own worst enemy?*

#### Talk vs. Work

> Real progress demands hard, unglamorous effort.

Talk is easy—work is tough, tiring, boring.

Talk:

- Discussing blog ideas in a coffee shop.
- Reading blogs for “inspiration.”

Work:

- Alone in a room, brainstorming next ideas.
- Rereading the blog six times.
- Shifting passive to active voice.
- Adding transitions.

Talk is cheap. **Real work is hard, tiring, and boring.**

Beyond talking, pride can further hinder progress.

#### The Pitfalls of Pride

- *I’m a writer because I have a blog.*
- *I’m an influencer because I have followers.*
- *I’m important because 20 report to me.*

That’s pride.

Good work thrives on feedback—but pride drowns it out.

Take Tamil superstar Rajinikanth—his films entertain kids, adults, and seniors alike because he listens and adapts. Pride would’ve limited his reach. 

Ask:
- How many blog drafts did I scrap to improve?
- Which new audience did my last post target?
- How many people did I help this week?

Lower pride. Amp up the work !

#### Dangers of Success

At a mountain’s peak, air thins due to environment. At success’s peak, reality thins. Ego makes us stop listening, learning, or grasping the basics.

> Handling success (like failure) requires effort.

**Can you handle success? Or will it ruin you?**

What happens when you don’t?
- Celebrities spiral into scandals.
- Sports stars squander fortunes.
- Historical figures like dictators fall.

What does handling success look like?
- **MS Dhoni**: Stays grounded, joins the Indian Para Commando unit as a Lt. Colonel, avoids tabloid drama.
- **Roger Federer**: Fame without scandals, always humble.
- **Genghis Khan**: A conqueror who remained a lifelong student.

As knowledge grows, ignorance expands. Humility keeps us grounded.

To sustain success, prioritize what truly matters.

#### What Truly Matters?

What’s more important to you?
- Double salary far from home or less pay near family?
- Work-from-home flexibility or a grueling office schedule?
- Stable salary or the high-risk, high-reward startup life?

{{< bigtext  >}}Without knowing what matters, success won’t satisfy—and it won’t last !{{< /bigtext  >}}

Especially with money: Without knowing your needs, default becomes *more*. Energy diverts from calling to bank-filling. Without essentials, happiness eludes—regardless of job, millions, or billions.

*To succeed without ego.*

*To push through failure with strength, not ego.*

**Ego is the Enemy** is more than a book—it’s a reference I revisit when ego creeps in. It’s a must-read for techies and anyone chasing meaningful success.

What’s one way ego’s holding you back? Share in the comments and let’s tame it together!
