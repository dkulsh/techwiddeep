The book starts by laying bare the successes and failures of the author himself. From a book consultant, strategist, one of the US's youngest talents to many failures. To ending up in the hospital with a panic attack

To lay bare one's failure takes courage and humility. For this, my respect for the author grew

Ryan explains his success blindspots with too much storytelling. "Your talent becomes your identity and your accomplishments become your worth." In the software world

My identity becomes

I am an Infoscion (employee of Infosys)

I am a Googler

I am an ex-McKinsey

My worth becomes my bank balance of

20 lakhs or

2 crores

Since neither the company nor the bank balance stays forever, the change hits one's identity. And it hurts!

These insights set the stage for the key ideas in the book. Here are some of the ideas I loved.

#### Be a Software Engineer or Look Like a Software Engineer

John Boyd was one of the most influential strategists in modern warfare. Yet, most of us have never heard of him

The reason is: *He was a strategist and did not only look like one*. As Boyd said:

"One day you're going to have to make a decision...

- You can *be* somebody. You will have to make compromises and you will have to turn your back on your friends.

But you will have a club membership and you will get promoted and you will get good assignments.

OR

- You can *do something*.

You may not get promoted and you may not get good assignments and you certainly will not be a favorite of your superiors. But you will not have to compromise. You will be true to your friends and to yourself.

Your work might make a difference."

Having authority is different from *being* the authority.

Having the right is different from *being* right.

And from today's context:

Influencing someone is different from *being* an influencer.

Mentoring is different from *being* a mentor.

Impressing someone is different from *being* impressive.

*To be a software engineer or to do software engineering? Which way will you go?*

Building on this distinction, the book explores how ego permeates our lives.

#### Omnipresent

Ego is everywhere

I have...

- Witnessed talented engineers snubbing their bosses. A few months later they were fired.

- Bosses take credit for their subordinates' ideas. During hard times, they had to admit (embarrassingly) that they did not work on the "details" of the idea. And this discredited them.

While ego has always been around, with Facebook, Instagram, followers, likes, shares... it has just become more

Growing up in such an environment, our values make us dependent on validation and are ruled by our emotions. In such an environment, every success is assumed to be rooted in talent. But, *talent is only the starting point*

Your ego asks you...

Will you be able to make the most of your talent?

Or *will you be your own worst enemy?*

This dependency on external validation leads to another issue: excessive talking over doing.

#### Talk Talk Talk

"What's on your mind, Deep?" says Facebook.

"What's happening?" says Twitter.

"Start a post" says LinkedIn.

Blabbering on these platforms is easy, even sexy by today's standards

What is hard?

- Sitting in a room, thinking of ideas for the next blog.

- Reading the blog for the sixth time.

- Changing a sentence from passive to active voice.

- Using transition words.

Talk is cheap. *Real work is hard, tiring, and boring*

Beyond talking, pride can further hinder progress.

#### Pride

- I am a writer because I have a blog.

- I am an influencer because I have followers.

- I am important because 20 people report to me.

That's pride

Also, good work comes from feedback. And feedback happens when we douse our pride.

However, when my pride talks louder than the feedback's volume, then I will not hear feedback

Instead, work.

- How many revisions of the last blog were discarded?

- Which new demographic did I target in my latest post?

*Fun fact: Tamil superstar Rajinikanth is famous for ensuring entertainment for every demographic—young, adults, and old.*

No wonder he is a superstar.

- How many new people did I try to help?

Lower the pride. Turn up the work!

Success brings its own challenges, often amplified by ego.

#### Dangers of Success

At the top of a mountain, we breathe less air. This is because of the environment.

Pretty much the same way, at the top of our success, we ingest less reality—like stop listening, stop learning, lose grasp on the basics. This happens because of ego

Handling success (like handling failure) takes effort.

*Can you handle success? Or will it be the worst thing that happened to you?*

What does not handling success look like?

- Drug and prostitute situations among celebrities.

- Lost fortunes among sports stars.

- Failed dictators and kings from history.

What does handling success look like?

- Someone like Mahendra Singh Dhoni. He is not in the news for the wrong reasons. Might also be the reason he joined the Indian Para commando unit as a Lt. Colonel.

- A Roger Federer. He is famous and hasn't had many wives or scandals. He is able to handle success.

- Genghis Khan. A great success. A great military mind, he was always a student.

As our island of knowledge grows, so does our shore of ignorance.

It takes a special kind of humility to grasp that you know less, even as you know and grasp more and more

Once at the top of the mountain—*work*. It is the only thing that will keep us there

To sustain success, one must prioritize what truly matters.

#### What Is Important?

Double salary away from home? Or less near family?

Work-from-home flexibility? Or a grueling office schedule?

Low-risk stable salary? Or high risk/reward of a startup?

It is important to sit down and think about what is truly important. Without this, success will not be pleasurable or nearly as complete as it could be. Worse, it won't last!

This is especially true with money. If you don't know how much you need, the default easily becomes: *more*

And so without thinking, energy is diverted from a person's calling and towards filling a bank account. Without the important things in our lives, we won't find happiness. It won't matter whether you have a good job, are a millionaire, or are a billionaire

*Not to aspire or seek out of ego.*

*To have success without ego.*

*To push through failure with strength, not ego.*

In conclusion, I liked the book (should be obvious by now)

Even more, it is like a reference for me—to keep coming back whenever I need to

A good read

*Ego is the enemy and some added content.*
