#### Lessons from Gordon Livingston – Through the Lens of the Tech Industry

Gordon Livingston is a psychiatrist by profession. He shares the insights he learned from his patients in the book. However, the insights are as relevant to patients as they are to healthy folks.

Here are some of my most loved ideas, with a Tech industry perspective:

#### If the map doesn’t agree with the ground, then the map is wrong

During the early years of my career, I got **pretty good appraisals**. However, received **shitty raises**. Assuaging us, our managers told us …

- The company doesn’t have a budget. Or  
- The salary quota had been met for the appraisal cycle.

But then we also saw the company **quarterly results in the range of ₹30,000 crores!**

The whole situation was *confusing*, to say the least. And turned me and my friends (with similar problems) **grumpy**.

> Essentially the company was telling me:  
> *"You are a valuable employee, but don’t deserve a raise for being so."*

The **map**, in our minds, was that – we are good engineers. And so, we should get paid handsomely.

But it did not agree with the **ground reality**; we were paid poorly.

I understand now, that my map was **wrong** 😌 😊

While we did work hard, the **work wasn’t valuable to the marketplace** (and of course the organization).

#### Any relationship is under the control of the person, who cares the least


What happens during a strain in the employee-employer relationship?

**Large organizations don’t bother – and stay in control**  
Essentially, they tell employees:

> *“If you are motivated enough, move on. We can manage without you.”*

While it is true that large organizations have a bigger pool to choose from, they face challenges nevertheless.  

But the simple act of **“not giving a fuck”**, discourages employees from being a pest — and **keeps the control with company management**.

**Employees at some small organizations threaten to leave — and own control**. At some smaller organizations, employers **cannot manage without their employees**.  

Reasons might be: expensive replacements, sharp learning curves, or customer dependencies.

In this case, **employees** are the ones who *don’t give a fuck!*

**Result:**  

Employees choose their work hours, take desired leaves, and better negotiate salaries.

> Caring less gives more control in a relationship.  
> *(But don’t do it out of emotions. Lest we land into a stupid situation.)*

#### Perfect is the enemy of the good

Most of us have had **perfectionist bosses**. One’s who will give review comments on:

- The naming convention of methods and variables  
- Changing type of a variable from `Int` to `Short`  
  To save the few bytes of space in the memory.  
- Have us re-do the task *n* number of times. 🚧 🚧 🚧

They make us re-write code, normalize tables, and refactor design. And don’t stop until everything is **perfect**.  
And during this time:

- A project’s timelines are missed. 🚦 🚦  
- A client gets pissed. 🚩 🚩  
- A delivery manager has a nervous breakdown.  
- And not to mention – Irritated by the obsessiveness, **many team members quit**. 🚷 🚷

Idealists demand much from themselves, and others.  
While so, they are **insufferable** in many settings.

Steve Jobs used to have his employees work many days straight...  
Then, **throw away their work without looking at it!**  
And have them do it over again.

> We need idealists.  
> Just not in every situation.

#### The most secure prisons are the ones we create for ourselves

Avinash was a fabulous techie. He was curious, hardworking, energetic, and always positive.  

Working with the QA team, he added much value to both our team and that of the clients’.

But only a few years into his job, he **married his profile** – that of a *“QA team member”*.

> Essentially, he built a *“testing team member” prison*, and captured himself.  
> And **self-built prisons are very secure!**

No matter how much I persuaded him to move on into development.  And pick the latest tech stack — ones that might help him grow…

I simply couldn’t succeed.

Reading the book, I understood the power of **self-built prisons**.

Not holier than thou.  **Hopefully, I will see the ones I’ve constructed!**

#### Nobody likes to be told what to do

We have all had that **supervisor** — one who is always up to our ass with a torchlight 🔦.

The thought seems to be:

> *If I give up criticizing and directing those around me, chaos will ensue. Chores will not be done, dishes will pile up, rooms will not be cleaned, the house will fall down, homework will be ignored, school failure will ensue, followed by drug abuse, pregnancy, and a life of crime.*  
> *I can’t let that happen!*

This is called **“awfulizing”**.  

The idea is that any relaxation in standards or vigilance is the **first step towards failure**.  

And the **collapse of civilization as we know it**.

> This is a pessimistic view of human nature.

We are **not obedient people**.  

Most of us are the descendants of those who took **dangerous voyages** in pursuit of freedom and self-determination.  

And were willing to sacrifice a great deal in defense of these ideas.

> We are genetically programmed to **question authority**.

#### Final Thoughts

There were ideas I realized, I need to work on …

Like the **self-built prisoner** – that is me in certain scenarios. Or the **perfectionist** – again that is me sometimes.

I cannot say I loved the book, but I sure did enjoy it.  
A **good once-read!**
