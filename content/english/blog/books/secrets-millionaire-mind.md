#### Introduction

This book both discomforted and taught me.

T. Harv Eker talks about differences in the ways rich and poor people think about money. While other writers might discuss the same ideas in an abstract manner, like "think positively about money," Eker shares concrete actions like "do not be jealous of the rich."

Saying "*Lack of money is never a problem. It is a symptom of a deeper problem,*" Eker explains that our financial success is created by something inside our minds. He calls it our "Money Blueprint."

He calls out common money misbeliefs and goes on to dispel them, such as "money will get us security" or "money will prove that I am a better person." He explains that no amount of money can get us a sense of security or validation from those around us.

He goes on to describe specific differences between rich and poor thinking. Here are some ideas that hit home for me.

This sets the stage for exploring key distinctions in mindset.

#### Key Differences in Thinking

##### Poor People Think Negatively About Selling; Rich People Are Willing to Promote Themselves

I always felt that salesmen were manipulative, selfish liars. With such beliefs, Eker's idea was discomforting for me. He explains the need for selling in all arenas.

Now, when I think about it:

- If I don't sell my skills to my employers, then someone willing to promote himself might be promoted.
- If I don't sell my love to the woman of my choice, then someone else might woo her away.

I stand corrected and educated.

Building on this, another key difference involves how compensation is structured.

##### Rich Get Paid by the Result; Poor Get Paid by Time

I work at an IT company, delivering software for our clients. We have frequent discussions where:

- A leader would say, "But it doesn't work!"
- A programmer would say, "But I did my part."

Notice the difference? The leader is focused on the final result, and the programmer on his part of the effort.

Needless to say, the leaders earn more than the programmers do.

This leads to the importance of avoiding a victim mentality.

##### No Rich Victims: Victims Don't Get Rich, and the Rich Are Not Victims

Many people have a tendency to blame, justify, or complain about a situation.

Eker explains that a victim is not in control. Therefore, "by design," a victim mentality takes away power from us to make corrections in our lives. Without such corrections, nobody gets rich.

Stop complaining!

Finally, effective money management separates the rich from the poor.

##### Rich Manage Their Money Well; Poor Mismanage Their Money Well

I have some friends with "keeping up with the Joneses" syndrome. They spend on unnecessary furniture, gadgets, and clothing. Meanwhile, their properties and investments stay in poor condition.

Despite a healthy income, they often come asking for a loan. No points for guessing that their financial situation never gets better.

#### Conclusion

I've read the book almost four times by now and loved that the presented ideas are very concrete. Such clear advice helped me understand the actions to take (and not just feel good about reading the book).

"*It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.*"

Mark Twain

The book educated me about things I thought were sure but weren't so. Hope it does the same for you.
