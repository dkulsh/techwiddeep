**Live your purpose unapologetically.**

*The Way of the Superior Man* by David Deida isn’t just about men—it’s about embracing masculinity through practical spirituality. It’s a guide to living with purpose, passion, and authenticity, even if it sounds like an oxymoron at first. 

⚠ **Note**: The book dives into topics like sex and sexual polarity, so expect bold discussions.

#### Attraction to Women Mirrors Attraction to Success

> Men’s pursuit of women parallels their pursuit of worldly success.

Men are drawn to women, seeking to win their hearts, connect deeply, and share their essence. Similarly, men are drawn to the world, aiming to make an impact and leave a legacy. Both pursuits bring immense satisfaction.

Women and success often resist men, eluding their grasp. Many give up, but those who persist—sincere in their efforts and willing to share their genius—succeed. They leave a lasting *legacy* in both their personal relationships and professional endeavors.

#### Be Willing to Change Everything in Your Life

> True growth requires giving 100% to your purpose and letting go when it’s time to move on.

As tech professionals, have you ever felt stuck in a role or technology? Many engineers stay in the same job, role, or tech stack for years, feeling unfulfilled. Deida urges men to fully commit to their tasks, achieve their purpose, and then release it. In tech terms, this means:

- Switch `technologies` when they no longer serve you.
- Leave roles that stifle your growth.
- Move on from companies that don’t align with your purpose.

Uncertainty or fear may arise, but letting go is a natural cycle for growth. Feel the fear, the butterflies—then leap.

This adaptability ties into making decisions from personal conviction.

#### Act on Your Own Choices

> Decisions should stem from your inner wisdom, not external pressures.

Learning `AI` or `VR` because it’s trendy? Posting certificates on `LinkedIn` for likes? That’s chasing approval, not purpose. Deida warns that acting to please others signals, “I don’t trust my own wisdom,” weakening your core.

**When you deny your deep truth to please others, everyone senses your lack of authenticity.**

Others will notice this inauthenticity—whether in relationships or LinkedIn posts. Listen to advice, but trust your own judgment to build strength for the future.

#### Don’t Use Your Family as an Excuse

Consider this real conversation:

> **Me**: Why not study engineering at that college?  
> **Friend**: No, friend! How will my parents manage the generator or fetch heavy water bottles?

Ten years later, that person was alone, unhappy, and unfulfilled. 

> Ignoring your inner calling weakens your presence and impact.

Deida emphasizes that men have an *inner calling*. Ignoring it weakens your core, affecting those around you. Children learn by osmosis—a father who’s present and purposeful impacts them more than one who’s physically there but lacks direction.

#### Stop Waiting for Perfect Conditions

> Waiting for ideal circumstances dims your clarity of purpose.

**Men who live significant lives don’t wait for money, security, ease, or approval.**

I delayed starting my blog for too long, but once I began, the hesitation felt pointless. Whether it’s changing jobs, learning a new skill, reading a book, or launching a startup—*start now*!

This urgency aligns with embracing core aspects of masculinity.

#### Attraction to the Feminine Is Inevitable

> Embracing natural drives fuels authenticity.

No explanation needed—men’s attraction to the feminine is universal. 😄

#### Final Thoughts

Deida’s approach to masculinity—emphasizing *following your inner calling*—resonated deeply with me. I was conditioned to obey parents, teachers, and bosses, often leaving me unsatisfied. Deida’s insight that ignoring your calling breeds dissatisfaction hit home. I’ve read this book three times and revisit it yearly, yet I feel I’ve grasped only 60% of its depth—a testament to its richness, not a flaw.

This book stands out for its bold take on masculinity and purpose. I highly recommend it to all men seeking authenticity.
