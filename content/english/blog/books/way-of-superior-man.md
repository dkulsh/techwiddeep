How men ought to live their lives to have the greatest satisfaction. This book is more about masculinity and less about men. It explores practical spirituality for men (sounds like an oxymoron, but wait until you read the book).

âš  The book talks about sex, sexual polarity, and other such topics.

These concepts from the book particularly resonated with me. Let's dive into the key ideas.

#### Our Attraction Towards Women Is Similar to Our Attraction to Success

Men are attracted to women. We like to woo them, penetrate them, and pass on our identity into them. Similarly, we are attracted to the world. We like to woo the world, penetrate it, and pass on our identity into the world. Men get great satisfaction doing this.

Women and success elude men, resist them. Most men give up during this pursuit. But those who are sincere, persistent, and willing to pass on their genius succeed. They *fuck* both and will leave their *legacy of intercourse with the woman and the world*.

Building on this idea of pursuit and persistence, the book emphasizes the importance of adaptability in life.

#### Be Willing to Change Everything in Your Life

As techies, have you ever felt bored with your technology or role? I know many engineers who stay at the same organizations, roles, and technologies for years, and remain unsatisfied.

David Deida says that men must be willing to give 100% to the task, fulfill their purpose, and then completely let go of it. In tech terms, this translates to:

- Be willing to leave your current technology and move on to a new one.
- Be willing to leave your current role and move on.
- Be willing to leave your company and move on.

We feel uncertainty, fear, butterflies in our stomachs, and so on. But letting go is important.

Giving 100% and then letting go are natural cycles for men.

This willingness to change ties into making decisions based on personal conviction rather than external pressures.

#### Men Must Act on Their Own Choice

They must neither do things to please others, nor should they do it out of burden, fear, or expectation.

Our world has emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, virtual reality, and more. I also know people who learn new technologies because it is fashionable to do so. Sharing certificates on LinkedIn or Facebook helps garner likes.

Deida says that when we take actions to please others, we are in effect saying, "I don't trust my own wisdom." We are weakening ourselves.

People seeing our LinkedIn or Facebook posts will feel the fakeness. *When you deny your deep truth to please your woman, everyone will feel your lack of authenticity*. *They won't trust you, since you don't trust your own core intent*.

Listen to others but make your own decisions. You might be right or wrong, but in the end, you will strengthen yourself for the future.

Acting on one's own choices also means not hiding behind excuses, especially family obligations.

#### Don't Use Your Family as an Excuse

Following is a true conversation:

Me: "Why don't you go and study engineering at that college?"

Other: "No, yaar! How will my parents start the generator? Who will fetch the heavy water bottles?"

Ten years later, the person is alone, unhappy, and unfulfilled.

Most men have their inner calling. If they do not respond to this calling, then their core weakens. Children learn from osmosis. If their father is weakened, then the kids experience a weakened flavor of love.

A short time spent with a father who is fully present, sure of his mission, will affect children much more than if they spend lots of time with a father who is ambiguous in his deepest purpose.

Embracing this inner calling requires not waiting for perfect conditions in life.

#### Stop Hoping for the Completion of Anything in Life

*Men who have lived significant lives have not waited. Not for money, security, ease, or women. Each moment wasted degrades your clarity of purpose*.

I waited for a long time before starting my blog. Now that I have started it, I feel great. The delay I made makes no sense anymore.

Next time you feel like changing jobs, learning a new technology, reading a book, or creating a startup, start now!

Beyond these practical lessons, the book acknowledges fundamental aspects of male nature.

#### Attraction to Feminine Is Inevitable

I cannot put a finger on it, but something in this book resonated with me. I loved this book. I've read it three times and keep reviewing it a couple of times a year.

David Deida talks about masculinity in a way most don't. He talks about listening to one's inner calling; in fact, he encourages it. I was programmed to do the opposite: to obey my parents, teachers, society, bosses, and others. And understandably, I was unsatisfied.

When Deida mentions that ignoring one's calling makes one dissatisfied, that resonated with me.

Also, I believe I understood only 60% of the book. To clarify, this is not a criticism of the book, but rather a reflection of my abilities.

This book is unlike most books I've read. I recommend it for all men.
