We techies often overlook our clothes and dressing sense. This blog aims to highlight this habit and encourage a change.

Some points I mention may sound prejudicial, partly because they relate to cultural differences.

## My Background

Growing up in a small North Indian town, I never realized how much "looks" mattered. Sure, I saw fancy-looking folks, but their extra effort always seemed unnecessary, just to impress others. ![North Indian style icon](/images/one-techie-to-another-dress-up/north-indian-style-icon.png) ![North Indian style icon](/images/one-techie-to-another-dress-up/north-indian-style-icon-2.png)

Then I moved to South India, where I encountered simpler styles. South Indians lead modest lives, reflected in their straightforward dressing.

Even as a simply dressed North Indian, the South Indian approach was a shock. I had seen dull colors before, but never such disregard for combinations, accessories, and overall appearance.

Let's respect cultural differences and accept them as they are.

A happy side effect: an under-dressed North Indian became an over-dressed South Indian.

Later, I moved to the US for work, facing another surprise. Westerners are conscious of their presentation, likely a cultural trait.

From crisp ironed collared shirts to polished shoes, and clean-shaven faces to trimmed beards, they looked sharp. Europeans took it a step further. ![European style icon](/images/one-techie-to-another-dress-up/european-style-icon.png) ![European style icon](/images/one-techie-to-another-dress-up/european-style-icon-2.png)

Most appeared presentable.

Back in a tier-2 Indian city, I notice the lack of attention to dressing again. This inspired this blog.

Building on these experiences, let's explore the benefits of dressing well.

## Why Bother?

Why dress well? If a picture is worth a thousand words, these images can save even more explanation.

Pause and think: What appeals to you in these packagings?

![Product packaging comparison](/images/one-techie-to-another-dress-up/product-packaging-comparison.jpg) ![Product packaging 1](/images/one-techie-to-another-dress-up/product-packaging-1.jpg)

![Product packaging 2](/images/one-techie-to-another-dress-up/product-packaging-2.jpg) ![Product packaging 3](/images/one-techie-to-another-dress-up/product-packaging-3.jpg)

- How were the color combinations?
- Did the packaging enhance usability?
- Did it increase desirability?
- Would the better-packaged product sell at a higher price?
- Most pertinent: Does packaging raise the selling price?

**Hint: It does!**

If we engineers are products, our clothes are the packaging, and employers are clients subscribing to our services for salaries.

**Would clients pay more for better-packaged products?**

Absolutely, yes!

![Salary study chart](/images/one-techie-to-another-dress-up/salary-study-chart.jpg)

Studies show better-dressed people earn higher salaries, aligning with what we've discussed.

This is why we should care about dressing well.

Now that we've seen the value, consider how dressing influences perceptions.

## Act Like a King to Be Treated Like One

People who dress better get more attention. Ever met an army officer or successful doctor?

Living near an army cantonment, I see JCOs and jawans at marketplaces. Recently, a plainly dressed girl (an officer's daughter) arrived in a smart SUV with a sharp-looking jawan. She was treated like a VIP and jumped the queue ahead of me.

Treated like royalty because they appeared the part.

![Army officer treatment](/images/one-techie-to-another-dress-up/army-officer-treatment.jpg)

We are superficial beings, despite what we might think.

- Your secret crush: Do they usually look good?
- The pretty girl on the street you turned to see: Was she well dressed?
- Folks you follow on social media: Are they put together?

You bet they are!

To be treated like a king, meet the expectations of one.

**If we dress like commoners, we'll be paid like them. Does dressing well seem more important now?**

Understanding these perceptions leads to what our attire communicates.

## The Derivation

What does your dressing sense say about you?

Some dress above their job level, others below.

**Both communicate: one says "I am better," the other "I am *not*."**

![Dressing sense communication](/images/one-techie-to-another-dress-up/dressing-sense-communication.jpg)

An engineer dressing well despite urgent issues says, "I value myself, I'm not rushed, and I'm in control."

A manager with shining shoes despite multiple projects says, "I'm still here and holding on."

Leaders notice these non-verbal cues. A VP might think of a well-dressed engineer: If they attend to small details like shining shoes, they likely handle big ones too.

Guess who's next for promotion?

Dressing well reveals our inner state and how we present to the world.

**You can't *not* communicate. The question is, how will you?**

Despite these advantages, why do engineers resist? Let's examine the reasons.

## Why Do We Engineers Resist?

This information is widely available, yet we resist dressing better despite the benefits.

### Impact to Work

We believe time on dressing (which we don't enjoy) detracts from work (which we love).

This is partly true.

![Engineering work illustration](/images/one-techie-to-another-dress-up/engineering-work-illustration.jpg)

**Engineering is hard work, and we love it!**

Other tasks interrupt deep thinking, like cosmetic ones such as dressing.

But I don't fully buy it because we do non-work activities like meetings and coffee breaks.

Are all coffee breaks essential? We could skip some without issue.

And meetings? I have a blog on their inefficiencies: [Meetings](https://techwiddeep.com/meetings-the-clusterfuck-of-it-industry/)

Yet we do them habitually, automatically, without motivation drain.

Similarly, grooming can become a habit with long-term benefits.

### Social Proof

![Zuckerberg Jobs example](/images/one-techie-to-another-dress-up/zuckerberg-jobs-example.jpg)

Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs didn't focus on appearance. Zuckerberg wears grey t-shirts and jeans; Jobs, black turtlenecks and jeans.

But this is misleading. They're already successful. Are you?

Once proven, looks matter less. Zuckerberg isn't seeking promotions.

We are, so poor dressing isn't an option.

I worked with someone in crumpled clothes; people whispered about his un-leader-like appearance. But he was successful and unbothered.

Don't follow the wrong examples.

While practical, there's a risk of overdoing it.

## The Trapdoor

![Vanity trap illustration](/images/one-techie-to-another-dress-up/vanity-trap-illustration.jpg)

Dressing can be excessive. When for ego, it becomes vanity, wasting time.

Do I always dress well? No.

Do I dress well reasonably? Yes.

That's my takeâ€”now suit yourselves!
