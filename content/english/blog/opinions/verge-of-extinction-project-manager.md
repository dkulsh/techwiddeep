The traditional project manager is like a lion: king of its jungle and fast going extinct as a species.

Let's understand why project manager jobs are disappearing. To do that, let's examine how this role originated.

During the early days of my career, there were a bunch of us programmers at the bottom of the pyramid. Next were a few quality assurance team members. Then came our offshore lead, the onshore lead cum business analyst (we were an onshore-offshore model). Finally, at the top of the pyramid was the kingâ€”our project manager, who managed us unruly kids.

Only our manager understood the complete software development cycle. He was our "one size fits all" problem-solving approach.

- Business-related question? Let's ask the manager.
- Technical query? Check with the manager.
- Process-related help? Take a wild guess!

Essentially, the manager was a shepherd for us sheep. And the "need for such a shepherd" created the need for the project manager role.

This evolution sets the stage for understanding their decline.

#### Tasks

People in the manager's role typically had some 5+ years of experience. And they did tasks such as:

1. Business requirements fetching
2. Business requirement to tech requirements translation
3. Splitting, linking, and delegation of tasks
4. Planning capacity, thereby calculating timelines
5. Risk evaluations
6. Release notes publishing
7. Status reports sharing, and more

In other words, his role was to "oil the software-creating engine." An important job. But something within the tasks' nature also led to the role's extinction.

Building on these tasks, let's explore their characteristics.

##### Shallow

*Shallow task*: one that takes less time to learn  
*Deep task*: one that takes a long time to learn

Most, if not all, of a manager's tasks were "shallow" in nature. Meaning, the learning curve of each task was low. An average person could take up any one task after 1-2 weeks of training. Such "shallow" nature of the tasks became the undoing of the role.

(The shallow nature of the tasks also created a low entry barrier to this role. The low entry barrier allowed many incompetents to become full-fledged managers in 3 to 6 months. But that's just me ranting.)

This shallow aspect ties into another key factor.

##### Non-Core

I mentioned that a manager's role was to "oil the software-creating engine." This also highlights that the manager was not part of the software-creating engine. This is another reason for the role's extinction.

Notice that none of the above tasks produced or improved code. Sure, they supported the development of code, but hardly made a difference to the quality of the final product.

The tasks were mostly based on Excel sheets. So, I call them "Excel sheet managers." (Long live Microsoft!)

A manager role had its need. He had the most understanding of the development process and played a vital role in the team. Then the era changed, ushering in new efficiencies.

#### Automation Age

The age of tools began. Remember the "shallow" nature of tasks. A shallow task is easy to automate. So, many companies did!

![Automation](/images/verge-extinction-pm/automation.jpeg)

Many project management tools came in, such as Jira, Azure DevOps, Trello, YouTrack, etc. Suddenly:

- Task delegation: as simple as raising a ticket
- Dependency creation: automated
- Risk evaluation: click of a button
- Release notes: a few minutes' job
- Status reports: an auto-refreshable dashboard

Deployment management tools, like Jenkins, CA Nolio, Bamboo, etc., reduced the code release headaches.

- Install and rollback instruction worries are gone
- Mammoth release planning teams are not needed anymore

Version control: Git, Bitbucket, and others.

- Code conflicts and version issues are taken away
- Repository confusions removed
- Code check-ins risks averted

A lot of work got automated, and each automation chipped away at the manager's tasks. Till one day, companies realized: if half the tasks are automated, why pay a full-time employee for the remaining half? Managers became overpaid for their roles.

This shift prompted a reevaluation from the business side.

##### Organization's Perspective

Let's look at this change from an organization's perspective.

A company exists to make profits, i.e., have more income and fewer expenses. With the incoming tools, managers' heavy salaries suddenly became "not so justified."

Also, if software can do the same job, then:

- One software can manage a bigger team than 20 managers could

This means more productivity and less cost.

- Unlike humans, software is consistent. This helps scale productivity in quantity while retaining the quality
- The company has no people management headaches like motivating, promoting, hiring, attrition, etc.

Sure, the software costs more, but it earns even more. Based on the cost-profit ratio, it was the right choice for most organizations. As organizations switched to software, the ratio of developers to managers became 100:1 from the earlier 5:1. Meaning, 19 out of 20 manager positions were eliminated. That was a huge saving for the organization.

(Opportunity: If a company needs new software, then it also needs someone with knowledge to manage it. More on this below.)

Beyond automation, external factors accelerated the change.

#### Business Changes

During business downtimes like the COVID situation, organizations tighten their belts. Since companies get paid for writing code, anyone not contributing to writing code is an overhead. The overhead can be kept during normal business, but during downtimes, the overhead needs to go first.

With the above in mind:

- Does the manager directly contribute to writing code? No!
- Are the manager's tasks complex? No!

After a while, team members become familiar with the "systems and processes." Once they do, companies could ask them to take over the managerial overhead and let the managers go. Remember, the manager's tasks were "shallow" and did not require a specialist. Since companies could, companies did.

Once a manager was removed, his tasks were redistributed among the existing team members (slightly overloading them). Impact to code production was minimal, and organizations saved money during difficult times.

The automation age brought the project manager role to the edge of a cliff. Difficult business times gave the push. Down tumbles the project manager role!

To navigate this reality, consider proactive steps.

#### To Do

What do we do? Let's start by asking ourselves a question:

Does it take at least 6 months to get good at my job?  
Yes: Your job is safe.  
No: You should be worried.

The need for shallow skills is no more. As we discussed, this is because they have been automated. The market needs deep skills, translating to people who know things in and out. Deep knowledge might be related to the domain, technology, the company, a brand, or else. So long as the person has inside knowledge, he will be valuable to the marketplace.

For techies early in their careers, I recommend planning another growth path. The marketplace doesn't require vanilla project managers anymore.

For those already in project manager roles, you need to add more value than the role demands. There are two approaches to do this, and remember, each will take hard work.

##### Go Wide

Engage in bigger aspects of the software-producing engine.

- Make recommendations to save money for your organization
- Bring in new business or improvement suggestions
- Create marketing ideas
- Help the sales team
  - Give them ideas for leads
  - Help them convert the prospects
  - Use your knowledge to get client confidence
- Learn basic technology and add value by directing the tech team
  - With CI/CD processes, DevOps teams have come into being
  - Software automations need people to guide them

**OR**

##### Go Deep

Pick one area the core role demands and become an expert.

- Be an expert at management tools like Jira: create dashboards, live reports, automated delegations, etc.
- Go into technology
  - Participate in designs, reviews
  - Write simple DB queries
  - Understand common tools: ELK, MQ services, DynaTrace, LoadRunner, and their uses

I believe that if someone does work that directly results in code, then his job remains safe.

(Disclaimer: I am a techie by job and heart. Therefore, I have a bias toward technology. Please use your discretion.)

Also, don't hide behind certifications. Certifications are good to keep the learner in us alive. That's it. In the real world, nobody cares about them. When software comes to take our jobs, no certificate will help.

When deciding, ask yourself: Does it take at least 6 months to get good at my job? If the answer is yes, your job is safe.

These adaptations align with emerging trends in the industry.

#### New Age Roles

I get unsolicited job calls.

Some calls are for the position of project manager. In the last 5 years, I have observed that almost all companies ask for tech managers, working with an 80:20 ratio, i.e., 80% of the work for the project manager position will be technical, and only 20% will be managerial.

This tells me that organizations now look to merge roles.

- A tech lead role with a manager role
- An analyst role with a manager role
- A client engagement with a manager role

This confirms what I mentioned earlier. Managers are overpaid. Therefore, manager positions are not viable to be paid separately anymore.

The trend of merging roles has created new designations in the industry. The new designations highlight additional roles managers play.

- Solutions Manager: Project manager + architecture/technical solutioning
- Program Manager: Project manager + client engagement
- Product Manager: Project manager + project delivery

These are opportunities for those looking to shift gears. Anyone willing to go the extra mile on the additional skills, i.e., client engagement, tech solutioning, has opportunities waiting for them.

In conclusion, adaptation is key to survival.

#### Final Thoughts

Yes, there was an era when projects couldn't be executed without project managers. But that era is gone. Now we are into COVID times. If you don't already know, the virus mutates with each attempt to subdue it.

I knew a manager; let's call him Neeraj. He was a good techie but also had a value-adding mindset.

Executing a project, he not only worked on completing it but also made recommendations to save future costs. As luck would have it, he received some funding and was able to execute his recommendations. The organization saved hundreds of thousands of dollars each year.

Next thing: Neeraj was promoted as a director and is happy.

I know many managers who lost their jobs. Neeraj won't ever be one of them. He mutated to add more value than he was asked to. Therefore, he is an asset to the organization. And assets aren't let go.

Project managers: Learn from the virus. Mutate to survive.
