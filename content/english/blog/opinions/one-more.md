# The Power of Thinking: Why Companies Need You Now More Than Ever

> **Companies that squelch thinking can no longer compete with companies that *champion* thinking.** Nor can you bully a subordinate into becoming a genius.

Since the modern, scientifically conceived corporation was invented in the early half of the twentieth century, *thinking* has been sacrificed in favor of forwarding the interests of the “team player.”

**Fair enough.** There was more money in doing it that way; that’s why they did it.

### The Problem with Team Players

There’s only one problem. **Team players are not very good at creating value on their own.** They are not autonomous; they need a team in order to exist.

So now corporations are awash with *non-autonomous thinkers.*

### The Endless Loop of Indecision

Developer to Lead – “I don’t know. What do you think?”  
Lead to Manager – “I don’t know. What do you think?”  
Manager to Business Analyst – “I don’t know. What do you think?”  
Analyst to Client – “I don’t know. What do you think?”  
Client back to the Analyst – “I don’t know. What do you think?”  
Analyst back to the Manager – “I don’t know. What do you think?”  

*And so on.*

### The Parasite Problem

**Creating an economically viable entity where lack of original thought is handsomely rewarded creates a rich, fertile environment for parasites to breed.** And that’s exactly what’s been happening. So now we have *millions upon millions of human tapeworms* thriving in the Western world, making love to their PowerPoint presentations, feasting on the thinking of others.

#### What happens to an ecology when the parasite level reaches critical mass?

**The ecology dies.**

### The Call to Action

**If you can think, if you can think *independently*, if you can articulate passion, if you can override the fear of being wrong, then your company needs you more now than it ever did.** And now your company can no longer pretend that isn’t the case.

> *So dust off your horn and start tooting it.*

And if you don’t see yourself as a particularly thinker, that’s not reality—that’s a self-imposed limitation. **Only you can decide** whether you want to carry that around with you forever. *Life is short.*
