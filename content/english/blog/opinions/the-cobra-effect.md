During British rule in India, the government grew concerned about cobra snakes and offered bounties for dead cobras. Initially, this strategy succeeded. However, creative individuals soon began breeding cobras to claim the rewards.

When the British realized the issue, they abruptly ended the program. Without incentives, breeders released the snakes, leading to a larger population of the deadly reptiles.

#### Perverse Incentives
When an incentive produces the opposite of its intended effect, it is called a perverse incentive. The cobra effect exemplifies this, as the plan to reduce the snake population actually increased it.

To apply this lesson in other contexts, let's explore its relevance in information technology.

#### Information Technology
What can we learn from this in IT companies?

Have you ever encountered a long-running project?

Sometimes, the reason is that rewarding problem-solvers inadvertently promotes the problems themselves.

Technology teams may be encouraged to work inefficiently (like breeding cobras), because those who solve problems later (killing cobras) receive rewards.

If the incentive is to close a bug or resolve an issue, there is no incentive to avoid the problem in the first place.

If the incentive is to kill a cobra, it also sustains the cobra population.

Now, let's add another dimension to the discussion.

#### Visible vs. Invisible Work
Solving an issue is a "visible" exercise, whereas avoiding one is an "invisible" one.

Solving a bug usually requires:

1. A ticket assigned to a techie.

   *This adds to the person's performance metrics.*

2. Discussions with others, including meetings.

   *This makes the person appear busy.*

3. Working late.

   *Again, a visible effort.*

4. Others in the team recognize that the techie is solving a problem they might not have.

   *This brings social status to the person.*

All of the above are visible tasks, which are easy to reward.

In contrast, avoiding problems involves less noticeable efforts.

1. When a techie avoids problems, no new bugs or issues arise.

   *The result is invisible.*

2. The techie discusses potential edge cases with someone.

   *Most people don't realize the discussion happened; it is invisible.*

3. The techie doesn't have much to show because they mostly sit and think.

   *The number of tickets assigned to them is few to none.*

4. They don't work late and are hardly stressed.

   *Adding to their invisibility.*

5. Many people reach out privately, afraid that openly asking questions might compromise their authority.

   *This adds to the invisibility of the techie's work.*

Notice that most avoidance work is invisible.

With this understanding, let's discuss how to apply these insights in IT organizations.

#### Advice for Techies
Do you focus on killing cobras or also on avoiding them?

Do you choose invisible tasks or only visible ones?

Visible tasks are easier and more rewarding. Invisible tasks are difficult and not always rewarded.

Technology is opaque, and details of code or modules are hard to discern. You know more than your superiors do (I know it, and you know it).

So, the next time you discover something important, informing the right parties is your responsibility, even if it isn't part of your defined role.

But why bother?

That's a fair question. Consider this perspective: Job descriptions often include terms like "self-driven," "ownership," and "leader." These imply that part of your salary compensates you for taking ownership.

If the business analyst, QA team, or manager becomes the scapegoat, then you lack ownership and may not deserve your full salary.

Now, let's flip the equation.

#### Seeking More Salary
Want more salary? Start taking more ownership!

Cultivate an *inner sense of captaincy*. Will this always help you?

No!

I want to be clear: Invisible work will not always be liked or rewarded. You might have a lethargic lead or an ineffective manager.

Then why bother?

My question is, are you focused on the short term or the long term?

- Short term: Doing as told and keeping bosses happy might be better.
- Long term: Performing invisible and difficult tasks is a stronger bet, even at the risk of being disliked or unrewarded.

In the long term, your proactiveness *will* benefit you.

Shifting focus, let's address corporations.

#### Advice for Corporations
All teams need people who can kill cobras, that is, solve problems. Their value should not be undermined.

At the same time, not needing them is an even better option.

If the focus is on resolving as many bugs as possible, then it isn't on avoiding them initially.

![Blurry Focus](/images/cobra-effect/blurry-300x191.png)

When the British focused on killing cobras, they weren't focused on preventing their presence.

If the focus is on speed, it isn't on choosing the right approach. You might run as fast as possible when a bus would be more efficient.

As the Farnam Street blog notes: "It's worth asking why, if we think something is worth saving, we don't put more effort into protecting it ahead of time."

If the number of bugs solved is a performance signal, then the scarcity of bugs is also a performance signal.

I am not qualified to speak about incentives. That said, I believe signals should be appreciated but not rewarded. If they are, signaling becomes the goal, not the work. For example:

- If solving more bugs is rewarded, techies will find ways to create and solve more bugs.
- If the techie with the fewest bugs is rewarded, others will find ways to keep issues silent.

In these cases, incentives become perverse, producing the opposite of the intended effect.

A public acknowledgment or thank-you note might suffice, but a promotion, raise, or bonus could have the opposite effect.

Instead, rewards should tie to end goals, such as signoff, project delivery, handover to support, or meeting deadlines. In these cases, people focus on getting the job done rather than just solving more bugs.

#### Final Advice
Avoid cobras; don't just kill them.
