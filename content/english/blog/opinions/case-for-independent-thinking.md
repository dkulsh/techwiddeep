## The Value of Independent Thinking

**Companies that squelch *thinking* can no longer compete with companies that champion *thinking*.** Nor can you bully a subordinate into becoming a genius.

![Thinking sacrificed in corporations](/images/case-for-independent-thinking/thinking-sacrificed-corporations.png)

Since the modern, scientifically conceived corporation was invented in the early half of the twentieth century, *thinking* has been sacrificed in favor of forwarding the interests of the "team player."

Fair enough. There was more money in doing it that way; that's why they did it.

## Limitations of Team Players

There's only one problem. Team players are not very good at creating value on their own. They are not autonomous; they need a team in order to exist.

So now corporations are awash with non-autonomous thinkers.

This lack of independence often leads to a chain of indecision, as illustrated below.

*Developer to Lead -* "I don't know. What do you think?"

*Lead to Manager -* "I don't know. What do you think?"

*Manager to Business Analyst -* "I don't know. What do you think?"

*Analyst to Client -* "I don't know. What do you think?"

*Client back to the Analyst -* "I don't know. What do you think?"

*Analyst back to the Manager -* "I don't know. What do you think?"

And so on.

## The Rise of Parasites

Creating an economically viable entity where lack of original thought is handsomely rewarded creates a rich, fertile environment for parasites to breed. And that's exactly what's been happening. So now we have millions upon millions of human tapeworms thriving in the Western world, making love to their PowerPoint presentations, feasting on the *thinking* of others.

This parasitic growth has severe consequences for any system.

What happens to an ecology when the parasite level reaches critical mass?

The ecology dies.

## Embracing Independent Thinking

If you *can think*, if you can think independently, if you can articulate passion, if you can override the fear of being wrong, then your company needs you more now than it ever did. And now your company can no longer pretend that isn't the case.

It's time to take action and showcase your abilities.

So dust off your horn and start tooting it.

And if you don't see yourself as particularly *thinker*, that's not reality, that's a self-imposed limitation. Only you can decide whether you want to carry that around with you forever. Life is short.
