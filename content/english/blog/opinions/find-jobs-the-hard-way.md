Covid times are tough for job seekers. On one hand, technology has taken out jobs. On the other, companies have cut jobs due to financial strains.

LinkedIn pleas asking for help to get a job are aplenty. As job seekers, what do we do? **Here is an approach that on one hand is *not* easy, on the other works!**

Before I explain the method, I would like to apologize for writing long texts.

Admittedly, I have a bad habit of ensuring you, the reader, understand the content—even if that means reading lots of text.

You will see this habit in action.

To build a strong foundation, let's first consider the needs of organizations.

## What Companies Want

Covid or no Covid, organizations need and want sharp, qualified people. Period.

Anything else is bullshit.

While so, companies need to select the few good candidates from the crowd of morons.

![Companies want sharp people](/images/find-jobs-the-hard-way/companies-want-sharp-people.jpg)

In their shoes, how would I (or you) go about selecting the right candidate?

With limited time and energy, I would rely on some "signals." Meaning, some proof that the hire is a good fit. Such signals could be...

- Previous employment

I would assume a reputed company to have a good hiring process—one that would be able to filter the wheat from the chaff.

- Recommendations

Recommendations would provide a "social proof" of an individual's performance.

![Social proof recommendations](/images/find-jobs-the-hard-way/social-proof-recommendations.png)

- A college degree

Someone who has spent 4 years of his life (and lots of their parents' money) would be interested in building a career. Right?

Twenty years back, this was true—since very few graduates passed from even fewer colleges. Therefore, the system itself filtered out the "less-motivated" bunch.

Unlike then, now we have hundreds of colleges producing millions of graduates each year—notably paid for by their parents' money.

Turns out, few are motivated to work!

Since a college degree was a good filter 20 years back, it was used to find a qualifying candidate back then.

However, a degree is *not* a good filter anymore. Therefore, it is less used these days (lots of college graduates are lethargic and uninterested).

### Mindnote

In other words, if you are looking for a job in 2021, then a college degree is *not* as useful as you might think it to be.

![College degree not useful](/images/find-jobs-the-hard-way/college-degree-not-useful.jpg)

Once everyone had college degrees, no candidate had a distinguishing signal. However, companies still needed to recognize good candidates.

Filling the gap came online portals like Udacity, Udemy, HackerRank, HackerEarth, and many others. With their online evaluations, these sites claim to provide a "signal" of a candidate's worth.

This is the reason we see many companies using online test platforms.

I know that the criteria used by websites are bullshit. This is regardless of the platform's performance in filtering candidates.

These platforms test certain concepts. But **99% of people in the tech industry do not understand, remember, or use the concepts—meaning the evaluations are inefficient and can be optimized; an entrepreneurial opportunity.**

While my opinion stands, do companies have a good alternative to online platforms?

No.

So, like it or not, these platforms will stay! Period.

### Moral of the Story

Companies want a signal that you are a worthwhile candidate. And the signal changes over time.

Your responsibility is to understand this idea and provide a good signal of your abilities.

![Provide good signal](/images/find-jobs-the-hard-way/provide-good-signal.jpg)

Now that we've explored what companies seek, let's shift perspective to how they view candidates.

## From the Other Side of the Glass

What do companies see when they look at you?

They see a bunch of rag-tag nobodies—ones who think something of ourselves because we've written some lines of code. They are *not* wrong.

First, **college teaches only theory.** Such learning is very disconnected from the real world.

Second, even when some projects are done, they are very controlled—viz. the architecture is pre-defined, technologies are chosen, and the changes are well described.

At college, the goal is not to "learn." Instead, it is to "score well."

Since what is pursued is achieved, graduates get good grades and little understanding.

The next alternative to gain some knowledge is through online tutorials. Once again, while they claim to give real experience, usually they are a set of recorded instructions—again a very controlled environment. The reality of a project is very different.

I've conducted many interviews and have known candidates who were able to explain concepts. But given the simplest problems, weren't able to apply the same concepts.

This is because knowledge of a concept and that of its use are very different. Students only read about the concepts and never "understand" them.

First, we students aren't well educated. Second, there is also huge competition among all us incompetents. Any wonder we aren't able to get jobs?

Finally, think of this from a business' perspective (by the way, business is *hard*, harder than you'd ever imagine it to be).

Even if you are a good, prudent, skilled individual, why should a business risk its hard-earned $$ with someone with unproven skills?

This is the company's mindset.

If college, courses, and learning are all not useful, then it begs a question: **Why do we go through such torture to get a college degree?** Listen to our parents' admonitions, give away such a lot of money to colleges?

Why??

![College degree torture](/images/find-jobs-the-hard-way/college-degree-torture.jpg)

Understanding this disconnect reveals deeper issues in how we learn.

## Transfer Mirage

Formal education promotes an idea: that something learned in one context can be applied to another.

That is, learning content in a classroom helps us to become better software engineers. But I've been there, done that, and it doesn't happen!

If the idea were true, then...

- Someone knowing CPU functions might've been able to design a high-performance architecture.

- Knowing a LinkedList would've been enough to apply it.

Not the case in my experience.

- If someone knew multithreading, he would be able to use them.

But my interviewees couldn't.

**The idea of 'transfer' is *not* true. More than a mirage, such an idea is a scam.**

Excerpt from: Scott Young, "Ultralearning."

*…. in almost all the empirical work to date, on the role of example solutions. A student who has studied examples often cannot solve problems that deviate slightly from the example solution.*

*... Students receive honors grades in college-level physics courses. The same students are frequently unable to solve basic problems and questions encountered in a form slightly different from that on which they have been formally instructed and tested."*

**Transfer trap—traps us into thinking that using a piece of information in one context helps us use it in another.** Simply *not* true.

And this is the reason we go through the torture of college and end up with poor results.

But here we are. Since getting upset gets us nowhere, what do we do?

With this awareness, let's turn to practical solutions.

## What to Do

Within every problem lies its solution. Applies here too...

Since our problem is indirect learning, our solution is: **Direct learning**

![Direct learning solution](/images/find-jobs-the-hard-way/direct-learning-solution.jpg)

Here is a true story that describes it.

Excerpt from: Scott Young, "Ultralearning."

*Vatsal Jaiswal moved to Canada to become an architect. But just a few years after the 2007 market crash, getting a job was nearly impossible. Firms were laying off even experienced architects.*

*.... Vatsal sensed that the companies didn't see him as a useful employee. He had studied architecture in school, but his program had focused on design and theory. He had trained in projects that were isolated from reality. The reality of building codes, construction costs, and tricky software. Because his portfolio of school projects didn't resemble real-world projects. So, firms thought hiring him would involve training, something few firms could afford.*

*... He needed to show them that, rather than being a burden, he could get to work straight away and be valuable from day one.*

*To do this, he would need to learn how architects actually drew building plans with all the details. To do that, he found a job at a print shop, the kind that does printing for architectural blueprints. The job allowed Jaiswal to absorb details about how the drawings were put together.*

*Next, Jaiswal self-learned a design software called Revit. The software was commonly used at architecture firms.*

*Finally, with Revit and his new knowledge, he created a new portfolio. After a few months of work, he was ready. New portfolio in hand—Jaiswal submitted it again, this time to just two architecture firms. To his surprise, they both immediately offered him a job.*

Jaiswal's story highlights a few points:

- The market is always in need of "qualified" professionals—this even during the most desperate times.

- Indirect learning at college does not capture the real details of a project.

Learning from Jaiswal's story, to find a job we can...

**Create a working application—end to end: frontend, backend, middle-layer.**

(I warned that the method will *not* be easy and promised that it will work.)

![Create working application](/images/find-jobs-the-hard-way/create-working-application.png)

That's it! **If we create such a project and add it to our portfolio, then companies will look for us.** And not the other way round.

Of course, this will take time. But until you get a job, what else do you have in mind?

## Not Convinced Yet?

Please help me answer the below questions.

While doing the college project might've helped you do a number of things, it did not expose you to real problems like:

- Designing a primary key for a database that works for a distributed system and is sortable.

Think about it—this is what companies like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn need.

- What data structure would we use to store Amazon's inventory?

We know that it should be sortable by different keys—like earliest, cost, reviewed, recommended, etc.

- How many calls does the UI need to make to backend?

  - Is the backend service designed for such endpoints?

  - If so, then how many records will be returned from the backend service?

  - If too many, then is pagination implemented?

  - If pagination exists, is the page size optimized for performance?

  - Does the webserver cache static data?

- Does UI cache data to reduce the load on back-end service?

  - Does backend service cache data to reduce the load on DB?

  - Does the ORM cache data?

  - Does the DB cache data?

- What if the service shuts down abruptly?

Is there an auto-restart mechanism to start from the failure point?

- If the functionality is scheduled, then is there a way to trigger ad hoc?

On the other hand, if the functionality is ad hoc, is there a design to schedule it?

These are the types of problems companies face during software creation. And these are the problems companies want their employees to be able to solve.

I bet you do not know the answer to some of the above questions. This is because such questions can *only* be answered when we take a "direct approach" to work on them.

So next time when you see someone begging for a job on LinkedIn, give them a link to this article and ask them to...

**Create a working application—end to end: frontend, backend, and the middle-layer.**

Rest assured, they will get a job.
