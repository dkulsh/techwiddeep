We've all woken up feeling tired, possibly after sleeping the same number of hours, but disturbed. Though the same length, a disturbed sleep doesn't refresh us like a peaceful one does.

A similar phenomenon happens at our workplaces. For instance, sometimes I work for the same number of hours but do not feel productive. Why?

Observing my workday, I found that quick catch-ups, status updates, small queries, town halls, and more would keep disturbing me throughout the day. While I would've spent energy on staying focused, the frequent disturbances would've constantly taken the focus away.

Jason Fried explains the phenomenon in this [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/jason_fried_why_work_doesn_t_happen_at_work?language=en).

Meetings hurt productivity. This is a commonly understood phenomenon. In fact, popular websites have many blogs on the subject. These blogs explain some aspects of the occurrence‚Äîfinancial loss to organizations, poor agendas, wrong attendees, and so on.

While valid grievances, they come from consultants and other high-rankers of organizations. Meaning, the viewpoint is based on a bird's-eye view of the problem.

On the other hand, *I write from the trenches, not from a podium*.

![Trench](/images/meetings-clusterfuck/trench-300x219.jpeg)

Writing from the trenches, I explain the same phenomenon from what I'll call the "techie's eye view."

To delve deeper, let's examine the critiques from this perspective.

---

#### Critique

Meetings are necessary. After all, they help foster collaboration, are needed to get coordination, and "sound" good with other co-prefixed words.

But they have pitfalls too. Listing the pitfalls, my list of critiques is as follows.

This starts with the issue of over-invitation.

---

##### Panchayat

Panchayat is a village council in India. During panchayat meetings, the whole village gathers to discuss, debate, and sort out any differences. Unfortunately, the same thing happens with corporate meetings. That is, the whole village attends them!

![Village Meeting](/images/meetings-clusterfuck/image4-3.jpg)

What I mean is, huge participation reduces a meeting's effectiveness. This is because everyone has their own agenda.

- Leadership wants to know the cost of the work.
- Manager is concerned with the delivery date.
- Architects want a galaxy-level, high-level, mid-level, low-level, micro-level diagrams for the approach.
- QA lead would like to know when he can start getting billing for his team.

Meanwhile, the meeting was held to discuss whether we should add a new column in the DB! When the meeting concluded, everyone was happy‚Äîexcept the two developers who needed answers to their simple question. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Bigger the participation, smaller the results.

Beyond crowd size, the structure of meetings often mimics flawed systems.

---

##### Democracy

Panchayat has a panch or a village head. He is both a strongman and a strongly respected man. For the most part, his word is final.

Meaning, he can choose to address or dismiss concerns, allow disagreements, or push negotiations. In other words, should he choose, he can impose his will. This makes a panchayat more of an autocracy.

On the other hand, corporate meetings are democracies! That is, people do what they feel like.

- Participants are late.

The right participants are found missing from the meeting. This results in the organizer spending 10 minutes participant hunting.

Fun fact: We Indians are famous for being late. But the funny thing is, we have exported this commodity to the USA and other countries that were otherwise punctual (free of cost). üòÅüòÇüòÖüòÖüòÜ

- People go tangent.

Before long, someone forgets about the agenda and starts telling his love story. By the time the story ends, half the meeting slot would be gone. Worst part is that the story will be a boring one; no spice and all.

![Tangent Discussion](/images/meetings-clusterfuck/image5-1.jpg)

Unrelated subjects are a plague to meeting productivity.

- Some PMP-certified, MBA-stamped, Shashi Tharoor-type English-speaking alphas will want to show off the "best practices."

Less focused on what can be done, they will talk about "how things should be done." Or sometimes, how much they want to "contribute." Frustrated, we techies usually wait for them to shut up, so the work can be done (*though we would like to punch them in the face*).

Also, as soon as the real work starts, these fancy pants will leave the room saying something on the lines of "you guys can handle this stuff." Of course, we can handle this "stuff," Raj!

The above and other issues due to the democratic nature of meetings hurt productivity.

PS: *I love democracy and have nothing against it. Just the use of the model during corporate meetings.*

Another subtle issue arises from how meetings serve as distractions from actual work.

##### An Instrument to 'Feel' Like Working, Instead of Working

Our brains are the highest consumers of our daily caloric intake; up to 40%. But I doubt the science. This is because when I meet some morons, their bodies seem fine, but their brains are starved and non-functional.

![Meeting](/images/meetings-clusterfuck/meeting1.jpeg)

Technology work requires thinking. And *thinking is hard*. In fact, thinking is one of the most energy-consuming activities. For example, remember feeling hungrier during exam times? The late-night Maggi üç≤üç≤, bread-omelettes üç≥üç≥, chai-ParleGs üç™üç™?

Another fact is that humans are designed to conserve our energies. No surprises there.

Combining the two facts, what is a quick fix to conserving energy, i.e., not thinking while seeming to think?

Meetings, of course! This is a reason many like to "meet" rather than take a pen and paper and work through problems themselves.

True story:

One fine day, I was called to an urgent meeting. The meeting was to discuss what will be presented in a subsequent meeting to the big boss (*everyone wanted to ask others what to think*). End of the meeting, a follow-up meeting was planned to recycle the same agenda.

Did we achieve anything? Nope.

Did everyone feel productive? Yup.

An instrument to feel like working, while *not* working. A clusterfuck indeed!

Closely related is how meetings offload cognitive load.

##### An Instrument to 'Delegate' Thinking

Imagine that you are a manager and bloody incompetent at what you do. As it happens, you have to give a presentation to someone higher-up in the food chain.

What do you do? Call a "meeting" with your best techies. Of course!

Tell them that "we" have to give a presentation to the boss. And "they" need to prepare it. Next thing we know, they will spend time on preparing for you. Also, let's remember that the techies will not be able to spend time on their work. Therefore, they will need to work over the weekend to complete their otherwise timely task. But bloody hell, you are the manager and who's gonna find out!

Eventually, you call three other meetings where you follow up and ask them to make corrections.

Finally, you will *not* take them to the presentation with the big boss. God forbid, they take the credit and everyone finds out your incompetence!

There is a beautiful flip-of-the-coin result to what happens next.

- If the discussion with the boss goes well, you did the work, you are appreciated.

Heads you win.

- If the discussion goes poorly, then techies provided the inputs. Since they were the ones who came up with ideas, it's their fault.

Tails they lose.

A great plan üòÅüòÅ. High five! ‚úã‚úã‚úã‚úã

![High Five](/images/meetings-clusterfuck/image3-3.jpg)

You were able to "delegate your thinking." All in the name of meetings.

Finally, meetings can mask a lack of real output.

##### Cheap Tricks

Meetings can be used to falsify productivity.

True story:

I knew a manager, let's call him Sharad. Our friend used to ask everyone to add him to their meetings, even when not needed. Next thing, he used to "accept" the invite (unaccepted invites do not always show up as busy on the calendar).

Whenever asked about his deliverables, Sharad showed his calendar as a proof of his busy schedule. Meaning, the busy schedule was an excuse to *not* deliver anything.

This cheat code is very commonly found across tech organizations. So, I will not elaborate at length. Most, if not all, techies will easily understand this behavior.

As deadlines neared, a familiar story was repeated. Team came together and "pulled the project through." This is fancy talk for‚Äîothers did Sharad's work by working overtime.

But of course, Sharad was thanked for all the "contributions" he made to the project!

*God give them wisdom that have it; and those that are fools, let them use their talents.*

Shakespeare

The story says it all. Need I say more?

Wrapping up, do you feel the difference between the usual critiques and one coming from a techie?

Things look different from "techie's eye view," don't they?

Now that we've covered the problems, let's explore some practical solutions.

---

#### To Dos

Before we discuss the to-dos, I'd like to clarify.

‚ö†‚ö† I am a normal techie with a little bit of observation. Therefore, I am not qualified to establish rules and protocols. Translates to‚Äîplease use the suggestions with discretion. ‚ö†‚ö†

Having said that, I use every one of the below. And they have worked well for me.

First, take control of your meetings.

---

##### Less a Coordinator and More a Captain

As a techie and organizer of my meetings, I don't passively ride the ship. Instead, I actively guide it‚Äîcompass, anchor, and all.

![Captain](/images/meetings-clusterfuck/image7-230w240h.jpg)

My responsibility is to "understand" what is being discussed. And not just ask the other guy's opinion.

Essentially, my goal is not to have two viewpoints agree. Instead, it is to have my own viewpoint. And then, figure out which hybrid of the three views makes the best outcome. If my proposal is the shittiest, then so be it! I dismiss my proposal and thank the other person for bringing in his.

Also, guidelines don't always dictate my meetings:

- We end up discussing items off the agenda (that is when we have an agenda üòä).
- If the meeting ends in 5 minutes, then it ends in 5 minutes. No worries.
- But in case the meeting extends 1 more hour, then it extends 1 more hour. No complaints either.

What I do is against the popular wisdom of running meetings. But I don't run shitty meetings. So, I don't always need to follow the rules. Mostly, common sense and a little bit of hard work seem to work for me.

Inside my plane, I am not an attendant. I am usually the pilot.

Next, be intentional about who attends.

##### Be Mindful

"Bigger, the better" doesn't apply to meetings. So, if there are people who don't need to be on the call‚Äîlet them go.

![Mindful Meeting](/images/meetings-clusterfuck/image2-2.png)

In case there are five agenda items, I try to pick the shortest one first and let the relevant participants go. In the end, the longest discussion ends up with the least number of participants.

Also, if I let three people go, saving an average of 10 minutes for each, then I end up saving a cumulative of 30 minutes for the organization. But this number doesn't tell the full story. Because those 30 minutes are given back to the best techies in the organization. Meaning, those 30 minutes are really worth hours or days for the organization.

Does running efficient meetings sound more important now?

A side effect of this behavior is‚Äîthe best techies in the team are always willing to join my calls. In turn, I don't need to remind or chase them. While the brilliant techie might skip five other calls, he won't skip mine.

I respect his time; he reciprocates. This in turn raises my productivity compared to others in the organization. The intent wasn't selfish, but the side effect helps.

Reduce participation to increase participation.

Lastly, maintain focus by addressing disruptions.

##### I Shoot the Hijackers (Sort Of)

- If people hop off their chain of thought and go on a tangent, then I cut them off.
- In case people try to solve another issue, then I cut them off.
- Someone has a sob story to share.

While the story doesn't get time on my agenda, a "beer" meeting does (sob stories go easier with beer).

- When people have an unplanned agenda item, it gets added at the right priority. Translates to‚Äîmy agenda keeps the highest priority.

![Hijacker](/images/meetings-clusterfuck/image2-1.jpg)

Of course, I don't do this with the big fish in my food chain. Because not everyone wants to run efficient meetings, despite what they might say. And I don't want to push my luck.

Meaning, when I can, I hijack the hijackers.

#### Wrapping Up

I was a young blood fresh out of college, interning at a tech company. Suddenly, the VP came out of what looked like a tiring meeting and shouted out loud, "Meetings and mating, the only two things humans seem to find useful."

I was amused but did not understand it until much later.

My take: Do both, mate and meet‚Äîjudiciously!

Write back in case you have an opinion. Like what you read‚Äîdo like, comment, and share.
