> **Companies that squelch thinking can no longer compete with companies that champion thinking.** Nor can you bully a subordinate into becoming a genius.

Since the modern, scientifically conceived corporation was invented in the early half of the twentieth century, **thinking has been sacrificed** in favor of forwarding the interests of the “team player.”

Fair enough. There was more money in doing it that way; that’s why they did it.

#### The Problem with Team Players

There’s only one problem. **Team players are not very good at creating value on their own.** They are not autonomous; they need a team in order to exist.

So now corporations are awash with non-autonomous thinkers.

#### The Endless Loop of Indecision

```
Developer to Lead – “I don’t know. What do you think?”
Lead to Manager – “I don’t know. What do you think?”
Manager to Business Analyst – “I don’t know. What do you think?”
Analyst to Client – “I don’t know. What do you think?”
Client back to the Analyst – “I don’t know. What do you think?”
Analyst back to the Manager – “I don’t know. What do you think?”
```

And so on...

#### A Breeding Ground for Parasites

Creating an **economically viable entity** where **lack of original thought** is **handsomely rewarded** creates a rich, fertile environment for parasites to breed. And that’s exactly what’s been happening.

So now we have **millions upon millions of human tapeworms** thriving in the Western world, **making love to their PowerPoint presentations, feasting on the thinking of others.**

> **What happens to an ecology when the parasite level reaches critical mass?**
>
> **The ecology dies.**

#### Your Company Needs You More Than Ever

If you can **think**, if you can **think independently**, if you can **articulate passion**, if you can **override the fear of being wrong**, then your company **needs you now more than ever**.

And now your company can no longer pretend that isn’t the case.

> **So dust off your horn and start tooting it.** 🎺

#### A Final Thought

If you don’t see yourself as a **thinker**, that’s not reality, that’s a **self-imposed limitation**. Only you can decide whether you want to carry that around with you forever.

> **Life is short.**
