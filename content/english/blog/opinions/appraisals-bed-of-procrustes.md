Greek mythology tells of a figure named Procrustes. He had a stronghold on Mount [Korydallos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corydallus) at [Erineus](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Erineus,_Attica&action=edit&redlink=1). There he had a bed, in which he invited every passer-by to spend the night. He also had an obsession with making people "fit" in the bed.

As it happened...

- The guest would either be shorter than his bed.

If so, Procrustes would *violently stretch them so they would fit the bed*, killing them. Or

- The guest would be longer than his bed.

In which case, he would *cut their legs to make them fit his bed*. Once again, killing them.

The point of the story is... **Procrustes had arbitrary and rigid standards of evaluation.** (*Apart from the fact that he was a murdering moron.*) And he would violently apply them.

This ancient tale illustrates how rigid standards can lead to harmful outcomes, a pattern we still see today.

#### Procrustean Ways

We observe such ways commonly in our society.

- **36-24-36** is the Procrustean measurement for a woman. Those with these measurements are beautiful. All others are not.

- Students scoring **above 90% are smart** (or those that clear IIT/IIM). All others are idiots.

- Someone with a **$20 lakh per annum package** is better. And one with $8 lakh per annum is not as good.

Ever been judged by lines of `code` or hours clocked? The IT industry loves its Procrustean beds:

- Write **1000 lines of code**? You’re a star. Only 100? Slacker.
- Work **12 hours**? That’s dedication. 6 hours? Lazy.
- Solve **20 tickets**? Hero. Just 2? Get serious.
- Attend **10 meetings**? Productive. One? You’re not a team player.


**Arbitrary and rigid standards of evaluation applied violently.**

#### Problems with Procrustean Measurements

##### They Don't Work

From the 80/20 principle, we know that 20% of issues take the most time, and 80% get resolved quickly.

Indians have a saying: "Not all fingers are alike." Meaning, people come in different shapes and sizes. In the same way, challenges come in different shapes and sizes. If challenges have differences, their resolutions will also have differences in terms of complexity, invested time, level of the resolutions, and more.

So, comparing 1 high-complexity issue to several low-complexity ones is poor thinking. Let us consider this...

- A developer churns out **1000 lines** with minimal thought.
- Their lead writes **100 lines** for a mission-critical `module`.

Who has put in better work?

Procrustean standards would say the developer. However, we know from experience that the 20% lines of code are more valuable. *Ever been shortchanged by a dumb metric?*

**Procrustean standards don't work in the real world!**


Take a brilliant programmer from Kerala, coding like a wizard but struggling with English. The IT industry often shuns them for not fitting the “eloquent techie” mold. Yet, a kid like [Abhishek](https://www.newindianexpress.com/specials/2018/may/22/16-year-old-boy-from-kerala-wins-googles-international-open-source-software-code-in-contest-1817714.html) won Google’s open-source contest. Procrustean standards would’ve crushed him.

> Arbitrary metrics kill talent instead of nurturing it.

Imagine:
- Sachin Tendulkar flunking school exams.
- Angela Merkel missing the “36-24-36” beauty mark.
- Richard Branson sidelined for ADHD.

> Procrustean standards rob the world of genius.

##### Kill the Unfit

**Procrustean standards kill the unfit (instead of grooming them) and therefore are bad.**

- Imagine a Sachin Tendulkar being tortured for failing his school exams.

- An Angela Merkel for not fitting the 36-24-36 standards.

- Imagine a Richard Branson being outcasted for his ADHD.

- Imagine a Sylvester Stallone being rejected for his facial paralysis.

Killing such talents would've meant depriving the world of all their talents.

The same thing happens in the IT industry. Measured on Procrustean standards, talents of many techies are subdued.

##### Metrics Become the Goal

Rewarded behavior is repeated behavior.

Nine-hour workdays are common in the IT industry. Completing one's quota of 9 hours is also a big deal—a Procrustean measurement!

Since organizations look to get employees to clock their time, that is exactly what employees do. *Mind the fact that the hours are hardly ever "productive."*

Work stretches to fill the time, no more, no less!

Economics tells us: If the "number of tickets" is the goal, then engineers target the "number of tickets," despite the fact that they don't add value.

More so, engineers purposefully create issues so they can be solved later and give them credit. Meaning, rewarding problem-solvers results in promoting the problems.

*Explained this in another blog post:* [*The Cobra Effect - techwiddeep.com*](https://techwiddeep.com/the-cobra-effect/)

> When metrics are the goal, quality takes a backseat.

- Reward **12 hours**? People find busywork to fill it.
- Count **tickets**? Every tiny task becomes one.

Output suffers, but the Procrustean bed stays cozy.



#### My 2 Cents

In the movie *Moneyball*, Peter Brand, played by Jonah Hill, explains that there was a mad race among teams to buy the most expensive player, and this was so across the industry.

*The idea being: Matches are won by better players. Better players are more expensive. So buy them. The cost of a player was a Procrustean metric! (Expensive equals better.)*

Since the target is to win, instead, Brand explained, teams should focus on buying runs.

- The player is inexperienced but scores runs... Buy him!

- He is in the news for the wrong reasons but scores runs... Buy him!

- He is old but scores runs... Buy him!

This change brought a paradigm shift within the industry and also brought massive changes in the fortunes of the team.

Something similar needs to happen within information technology.

*The idea being: Softwares have lines of code. So, writing more lines of code equals a better engineer. Lines of code is a Procrustean metric!*

**Similarly, the following should not be goals...**

- More work hours.

- More lines of code.

- More solved tickets.

- More meetings.

**The goal is to deliver software.** While the functionality is delivered via code, hours, tickets, and meetings, these underlying metrics are *not* goals. Therefore, **trimming and stretching engineers based on such metrics leads to poor decisions**.

**A good system should reward and help techies who help "deliver." Period.**

Procrustes was eventually captured and killed. The same thing happens to his followers. His rigid standards didn’t survive, and neither should IT’s.

Easier said than done, but don't be those guys!
