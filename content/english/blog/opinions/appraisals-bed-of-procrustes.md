## Bed of Procrustes

Greek mythology tells of a figure named Procrustes. He had a stronghold on Mount [Korydallos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corydallus) at [Erineus](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Erineus,_Attica&action=edit&redlink=1). There he had a bed, in which he invited every passer-by to spend the night. He also had an obsession with making people "fit" in the bed.

As it happened...

- The guest would either be shorter than his bed.

If so, Procrustes would *violently stretch them so they would fit the bed*, killing them. Or

- The guest would be longer than his bed.

In which case, he would *cut their legs to make them fit his bed*. Once again, killing them.

The point of the story is... **Procrustes had arbitrary and rigid standards of evaluation.** (*Apart from the fact that he was a murdering moron.*) And he would violently apply them.

This ancient tale illustrates how rigid standards can lead to harmful outcomes, a pattern we still see today.

## Procrustean Ways

We observe such ways commonly in our society.

- 36-24-36 is the Procrustean measurement for a woman.

Those with these measurements are beautiful. All others are not.

- Students scoring above 90% are smart (or those that clear IIT/IIM).

All others are idiots.

- Someone with a $20 lakh per annum package is better.

And one with $8 lakh per annum is not as good.

In the IT industry, we see the same Procrustean standards.

- Someone writing 1000 lines of code is a better techie.

His colleague writing 100 lines of code is not as good.

- Working for 12 hours *proves* contribution.

Working 6 shows a *lack* of intent.

- Solving 20 tickets is *work*.

And solving 2 is *not*.

- Attending 10 meetings equals being more productive.

And attending 1 meeting is less productive.

While the application differs, the ideas remain the same.

**Arbitrary and rigid standards of evaluation applied violently.**

These examples highlight the flaws in such rigid metrics, which often fail to capture true value.

## Problems with Procrustean Measurements

### They Don't Work

From the 80/20 principle, we know that 20% of issues take the most time, and 80% get resolved quickly.

Indians have a saying: "Not all fingers are alike." Meaning, people come in different shapes and sizes. In the same way, challenges come in different shapes and sizes. If challenges have differences, their resolutions will also have differences in terms of complexity, invested time, level of the resolutions, and more.

So, comparing 1 high-complexity issue to several low-complexity ones is poor thinking. Let us consider this...

- A developer writes 1000 lines of code thinking very little.

- At the same time, his lead puts in 100 lines of high-quality code within a critical module.

Who has put in better work?

Procrustean standards would say the developer. However, we know from experience that the 20% lines of code are more valuable.

**Procrustean standards don't work in the real world!**

Beyond their ineffectiveness, these standards have other detrimental effects.

### Kill the Unfit

Speaking good English is one of the IT industry's measurement units. Let us consider this to be a Procrustean measurement.

Imagine a brilliant programmer from Kerala. While all is good, he isn't good with the English language. Wouldn't most of the industry reject (if not castigate) him? It would!

Now I tell you that the kid won Google's international open-source software contest! And that this is real. [Link here](https://www.newindianexpress.com/specials/2018/may/22/16-year-old-boy-from-kerala-wins-googles-international-open-source-software-code-in-contest-1817714.html) (*Not to say that Abhishek's English needs work. I'm sure it's great.*)

**Procrustean standards kill the unfit (instead of grooming them) and therefore are bad.**

- Imagine a Sachin Tendulkar being tortured for failing his school exams.

- An Angela Merkel for not fitting the 36-24-36 standards.

- Imagine a Richard Branson being outcasted for his ADHD.

- Imagine a Sylvester Stallone being rejected for his facial paralysis.

Killing such talents would've meant depriving the world of all their talents.

The same thing happens in the IT industry. Measured on Procrustean standards, talents of many techies are subdued.

![Talent suppression illustration](/images/appraisals-bed-of-procrustes/talent-suppression-illustration.jpg)

This suppression extends to how metrics influence behavior.

### Metrics Become the Goal

Rewarded behavior is repeated behavior.

Nine-hour workdays are common in the IT industry. Completing one's quota of 9 hours is also a big dealâ€”a Procrustean measurement!

Since organizations look to get employees to clock their time, that is exactly what employees do. *Mind the fact that the hours are hardly ever "productive."*

Work stretches to fill the time, no more, no less!

Economics tells us: If the "number of tickets" is the goal, then engineers target the "number of tickets," despite the fact that they don't add value.

More so, engineers purposefully create issues so they can be solved later and give them credit. Meaning, rewarding problem-solvers results in promoting the problems.

*Explained this in another blog post:* [*The Cobra Effect - techwiddeep.com*](https://techwiddeep.com/the-cobra-effect/)

- If working 12 hours is rewarded, then people will find tasks to work for 12 hours.

- In case tickets are a measure of work, then every small task becomes a ticket.

While so, output quality does not improve.

## Word of Caution

Lines of code, the number of tickets, and length of documents are valid measurement units. *So, someone writing 0 lines of code in 6 months is surely in a different universe compared to someone writing 5000 lines of code during the same time.*

*However, 100 lines of code in a critical place can have a bigger effect compared to 1000 lines of code at less relevant places.*

Reflecting on these issues, here's a perspective on improvement.

## My 2 Cents

In the movie *Moneyball*, Peter Brand, played by Jonah Hill, explains that there was a mad race among teams to buy the most expensive player, and this was so across the industry.

*The idea being: Matches are won by better players. Better players are more expensive. So buy them. The cost of a player was a Procrustean metric! (Expensive equals better.)*

Since the target is to win, instead, Brand explained, teams should focus on buying runs.

- The player is inexperienced but scores runs... Buy him!

- He is in the news for the wrong reasons but scores runs... Buy him!

- He is old but scores runs... Buy him!

This change brought a paradigm shift within the industry and also brought massive changes in the fortunes of the team.

Something similar needs to happen within information technology.

*The idea being: Softwares have lines of code. So, writing more lines of code equals a better engineer. Lines of code is a Procrustean metric!*

**Similarly, the following should not be goals...**

- More work hours.

- More lines of code.

- More solved tickets.

- More meetings.

**The goal is to deliver software.** While the functionality is delivered via code, hours, tickets, and meetings, these underlying metrics are *not* goals. Therefore, **trimming and stretching engineers based on such metrics leads to poor decisions**.

**A good system should reward and help techies who help "deliver." Period.**

Procrustes was eventually captured and killed. The same thing happens to his followers.

Easier said than done, but don't be those guys!
