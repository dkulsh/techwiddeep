> **Companies that squelch thinking can no longer compete with companies that champion thinking.** Nor can you bully a subordinate into becoming a genius.

Since the modern, scientifically conceived corporation was invented in the early half of the twentieth century, **thinking has been sacrificed** in favour of forwarding the interests of the **"team player"**.  

**Fair enough.** There was more money in doing it that way; that's why they did it.  

---

### **There's only one problem.**  
Team players are **not very good at creating value on their own**. They are **not autonomous**; they need a team in order to exist.  

**So now corporations are awash with non-autonomous thinkers.**

### **The Cycle of Indecision**  

- **Developer to Lead** â€“ *"I don't know. What do you think?"*  
- **Lead to Manager** â€“ *"I don't know. What do you think?"*  
- **Manager to Business Analyst** â€“ *"I don't know. What do you think?"*  
- **Analyst to Client** â€“ *"I don't know. What do you think?"*  
- **Client back to the Analyst** â€“ *"I don't know. What do you think?"*  
- **Analyst back to the Manager** â€“ *"I don't know. What do you think?"*  

**And so on.**

### **The Parasitic Corporate Culture**  
Creating an economically viable entity where **lack of original thought is handsomely rewarded** creates a **rich, fertile environment for parasites to breed**.  

And that's exactly what's been happening.  

**Now we have millions upon millions of human tapeworms thriving in the Western world:**  
- Making love to their PowerPoint presentations.  
- Feasting on the thinking of others.

### **The Critical Question**  
**What happens to an ecology when the parasite level reaches critical mass?**  

##### **The ecology dies.**  

---

### **The Power of Independent Thought**  
If you can **think**,  
If you can **think independently**,  
If you can **articulate passion**,  
If you can **override the fear of being wrong**,  

**Then your company needs you more now than it ever did.**  

And now your company can no longer pretend that isn't the case.  

---

### **A Call to Action**  
**So dust off your horn and start tooting it.**  ðŸŽº

And if you don't see yourself as a particularly strong thinker, **that's not realityâ€”that's a self-imposed limitation.**  

**Only you can decide whether you want to carry that around with you forever.**  

##### **Life is short.**
