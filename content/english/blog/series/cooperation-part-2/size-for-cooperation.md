# Achieve Co-operation | Size

How the size of a reward or punishment affects cooperation at IT companies

#### Recap

Achieving cooperation and delivering results is a priority for IT companies.

As part of this blog series, we explore systematic concepts that help achieve cooperation. We've examined:

- [Detection of behavior](/blog/series/cooperation-part-2/detection-for-cooperation/)
- [Nature of rewards](/blog/series/cooperation-part-2/incentives-for-cooperation/)
- [Clarity](/blog/series/cooperation-part-2/clarity-for-cooperation/)
- [Certainty](/blog/series/cooperation-part-2/certainty-for-cooperation/)

Building on these ideas, today we discuss the importance of size in rewards and penalties.

#### Size

The size of a reward or penalty should be proportional to the size of the contribution (or lack thereof).

*Let a thief go, and he steals again.* (If a punishment is too small, it isn't effective.)

*Kill a thief, and other thieves start killing.* (If a punishment is too big, it triggers worse behavior.)

A general rule is to *keep it conservative*.

- A reward should be large enough to encourage work, but small enough to avoid greed and pride.
- A penalty should be large enough to deter the behavior, but small enough to keep the players in the game.

This balance ensures motivation without unintended consequences.

#### Too Big Rewards

Big rewards can lead to blind spots like greed and ego.

Handling success requires humility. The feeling of "I have arrived" can ruin careers, projects, and more.

Falls from grace are common among kings, presidents, bureaucrats, politicians, and film stars. While talent and hard work take them to the top, many can't handle success.

- Richard Nixon wasn't able to handle his success.
- Some Indian bureaucrats and politicians aren't able to handle their power.
- The founder of the Saravana Bhavan chain of restaurants wasn't able to handle his money and power. *He was convicted of murder.*
- Current affairs: Ashneer Grover (co-founder of BharatPe) seems to have been unable to handle his success. (Read news for details.)

It takes a special someone to keep working with the same humility despite the rewards (not because of them).

##### Double Salary

Priyanka joined as a business analyst with a product-based organization. Bright and energetic, she did good work and was noticed.

In her next appraisal, she was promoted to a PM role and her salary was doubled.

Priyanka had arrived!

Everyone noticed that suddenly she became edgy. Her requests turned into orders and remarks. Certain tasks suddenly became beneath her.

The gaps became someone else's faults. Statements like "Why should I" and "Not my responsibility" were thrown around. Her projects started lagging.

A few more months later, the blue-eyed PM quit the organization (or was asked to).

The size of the reward was too big and too soon for Priyanka. She could not handle her salary and stature. Since the organization rewarded her disproportionately, the organization was as much responsible for her failure as Priyanka herself.

Just as oversized rewards can backfire, excessive penalties can also lead to greater harm.

#### Too Big Penalties

Why are terrorists and murderers arrested and not just shot dead?

Think about it: Even when guilt is clear, why are convicts arrested and taken to court?

To answer this, consider what happens with the alternative protocol. What if all terrorists are shot dead?

For example, IS chief Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi blew himself up instead of being captured. Why?

He knew the penalty would be the biggest, so why not create the biggest damage.

When people have nothing to lose, they go all-out crazy, creating much more destruction.

The point is that too-big penalties damage more than they help.

The same applies to software engineers. If an engineer is threatened with firing at the first production bug, then:

- No engineer would be willing to work, or
- Projects will never get completed.

This highlights the need for practical punishments, recognizing that bugs are always possible.

Imagine a guy working on back-to-back production issues. Would it make sense to punish him for being late to the office?

Of course not!

*Someone fighting for survival should be cut slack on hygiene practices.*

I would get pissed at such a reprimand and might plan to leave the organization altogether.

As a reminder of the general rule: *Keep it conservative*. Meaning, penalties need to be of the smallest effective size.

Determining that size requires careful observation.

#### Right Size?

How do we know the right size of a reward or penalty? To be honest, I am not fully sure, but I know a working analogy.

![Size Right Amount](/images/cooperation part 2/size-right-amount.jpg)

When eating, how do I know when I am full? Well, my stomach tells me!

- Too much food, and my stomach complains.
- Too little, and it demands more.

All I have to do is listen!

In the same way, to get the right-sized reward for a techie, all I have to do is see, listen, and perceive.

#### Wrap Up

The *size* of a reward or penalty is the next piece of the puzzle.

Like eating, too many rewards lead to obesity, and too few to anorexia.

Both conditions cause detriment to the health not only of the techie but also of the organization.

Proportionate rewards and penalties are key pillars in an IT organization.
