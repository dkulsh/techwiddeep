# Achieve Co-operation | Quick Detection

How quick detection of behavior helps achieve cooperation at IT companies.

#### Introduction

Achieving cooperation and delivering results is a priority for IT companies. It is their bread and butter!

Missed timelines, delayed projects, stretched programs, and over-budgeted portfolios are common issues, especially within the IT industry.

To address these challenges, organizations implement systems such as performance bonuses, HR practices, team exercises, parties, and excursions. These efforts aim to build teams and foster cooperation.

As part of this blog series, we explore systematic concepts that achieve cooperation. Here, we outline the requirements for an effective review system.

Continuing from [How to Achieve Co-operation](/blog/series/cooperation-part-2/cooperation-it-company/), we begin with the first pillar.

#### Quick Detection of Behavior

If I, as a software developer, am being lazy, then even before I can be punished, my cheating must be detected. More importantly, it must be done quickly.

If the detection is fast and accurate, the punishment (or reward) can be immediate and precise.

- If I cheat, immediate punishment reduces my profit and increases its cost.
- If I perform, an immediate reward increases my ROI.

Immediacy thus boosts the prospects of successful cooperation within an organization.

Conversely, if my performance is rewarded quickly, it reinforces the behavior. If not, I might attribute rewards to luck, communication, attendance, or other factors.

A good example is Pavlov's experiment. Ivan Pavlov rang a bell each time he fed his dogs. As expected, the dogs salivated upon seeing the food. Eventually, they associated the bell with food.

Later, Pavlov simply rang the bell, and the dogs salivated. Had the food been served hours after the bell, would we see the same results? No!

If the stimulant and stimulus are too far apart, the behavior will not be reinforced.

The same principle applies to software engineers.

Building on this concept, let us examine a practical scenario.

##### Quick Detection

Consider a team of 10 developers where Deep is a lazy one.

His code fails to address all use cases, is buggy, poorly designed, and delivered late.

Deep's lead quickly notifies their manager. The manager reviews the details and issues a guilty verdict.

Within a few days, Deep is critiqued and asked to improve. Since the reprimand is immediate, he gains little benefit from his lethargy.

The ROI on lethargy is very low, and Deep is likely to correct his behavior quickly.

On the other hand, waiting a year for a performance review makes the ROI huge for Deep.

This highlights the drawbacks of delayed detection, which we explore next.

#### Slow Detection

From the same team of 10 developers, suppose some collude to avoid work. They make an understanding with their lead, who hides their mistakes and covers for them. In turn, the developers support the lead when needed.

Together, they devise tricks to divert accountability, redirecting questions to the business team, product owner, architect, or manager.

If you think this is uncommon in large organizations, think again.

Now cheating has become more complex, with additional dimensions:

- MVP version (minimum viable product)
- Delivery time
- Quality
- Requirements
- Cross-commit teams
- Internal teams
- Processes

Leadership cannot always scrutinize each dimension, so cheating is detected much later. This incentivizes laziness for developers.

In fact, many leaders are incapable of verifying all dimensions and only review final stages, such as:

- Number of bugs
- Client feedback
- Sales team review
- Delivered software feel

This introduces more complexity.

Unfortunately, these factors have other influences:

- The client might give poor feedback to promote a competitor.
- Product owners might not be competent to review technology.
- Bugs might be beyond the current scope.

![Detection Complexity](/images/cooperation part 2/detection-complexity.jpeg)

With all these complexities, detection and punishment become slow and inaccurate, raising the temptation to cheat.

I claim that all large IT companies, including Infosys, TCS, Cognizant, and Wipro, face this problem.

If the system detects lethargy slowly and only partially, then being lazy might seem appealing.

#### The Scale Problem

Consider an organization with about 100 employees and a hierarchy of around five layers.

Management must answer additional questions:

- Has cheating occurred?
- At which hierarchy or hierarchies did it occur?
- Who has cheated?

The scale problem compounds other issues, such as collusion, complexities, monitoring ability, and external factors.

If resolving these is slow, people have incentives to cheat.

I bet that all large IT companies like Infosys, TCS, Cognizant, and Wipro face this problem.

#### Wrap Up

Quick detection is essential for generating cooperation in an IT company. An annual or quarterly review does not serve this purpose well.

In other words, a good performance review system requires quick detection of behavior.
