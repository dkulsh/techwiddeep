# Achieve Co-operation at IT Companies

#### A Blog Series

#### Intro

> Achieving cooperation and delivering is a priority for IT companies. Their bread and butter too!

Missed timelines, delayed projects, stretching programs, over-budgeted portfolios are common. Equally so within the IT industry.

To solve these problems, organizations create systems. Like:

- Bonuses
- Performance reviews
- HR practices
- Team exercises
- Parties, excursions, etc.

These are all to build teams and so cooperation.

**As part of this blog series, we look at "systematic" concepts that achieve cooperation. Or ought to.**

To set the stage, let's explore what doesn't work effectively.

#### Bonuses

Bonus: A monetary incentive for a certain behavior.

![Money Incentives](/images/cooperation part 2/money-incentives.jpeg)

Let us start with a few questions:

- What behavior should an IT company reward?
  - Faster delivery - even if with some bugs.
  - Quality delivery (zero P1 bugs) - even if delayed.
  - Scalable design - with added development cost.
  - More lines of code - even when it's repeated.
  - Meeting timelines?
  - Documentation??

Answering the above questions is not easy, because companies go through cycles where the desired behavior changes.

*A startup needs fast delivery, whereas a large organization prefers quality. Furthermore...*

- *The startup might mature into a large organization.*
- *And a large organization might have a new project that needs a startup-type handling.*
- Fast delivery might mean zero documentation. On the other hand...
- A handover or attrition might need loads of documentation.

In such changing scenarios, how do you give the bonus? Do we reward a different behavior each time?

Building on these challenges, let's examine another common system.

#### Appraisal Reviews

Performance review months at IT companies are the most unusual times.

- English suddenly becomes the language of communication.  
  Especially with folks from the vernacular languages. *You see - vernacular is the casual mode of communication (but not during appraisal season).*
- Unlike regular meetings that stretch unnecessarily, "review" meetings are short. (They are discomforting for both the appraisee and the appraiser.)
- Eye contacts are avoided. (*Lest they tell the truth.*)

Like the autumn months, the greenery in the office landscape dries and starts to die. In anticipation of the upcoming winters!

- A lot of HR meetings happen.
- Coffee time gossip floats in the air.
- Folks of the same designation huddle with hushed voices.
- A curtain builds between the "us" and "them".

It's a time for revenge, grievances, proving, and other things. Many times it is not for performance reviews, and is for everything else.

**But why?** Here are some reasons appraisal systems give us heartburns.

- Virtual Nature of a Software  
  *We cannot see, touch, smell, taste, or feel software. This puts us at an immediate disadvantage while evaluating a piece of code or a techie.*  
  This is a major reason performance reviews are difficult.

A detailed blog on the topic @ [Why IT industry is fertile ground for Cheatcodes](https://techwiddeep.com/why-it-industry-is-a-fertile-ground-for-cheatcodes/)

- Human Variables  
  Humans are complex creatures. With our experiences and preferences, we are a recipe for imperfection.  
  Here are some factors that add to the broken system.  

  - Being Judged is Discomforting  
    An Indian girl dresses up to be "seen" by a guy's family. Ask her how she feels. Anxiety, stress, tense, pressure would be some of the words used.  
    Being judged in a professional environment is not very different. It creates anxiety.  

  - Comparison  
    "Apples to Oranges" do happen (and wastefully so).  

  - Biases  
    People bring their biases into performance discussions too. Dress code might become more important than the actual code.  

  - Only Critiques, No Suggestions  
    Critiquing is easy and recommending is difficult. Many a time - with only criticism and no help. Appraisals turn into a humiliation exercise.  

  - One Sided
  - Standard/Bureaucratic
  - Phony Feedbacks

IT companies depend on such systems for their growth. A system with so many flaws is at best unhelpful, and at worst a hypocrisy.

Shifting focus, let's consider team-building efforts.

#### Team Building - Parties, Excursions

We pick the next tool set - from the HR's playbook. A team bowling event, a dine-out, paintball battles, secret santa, treasure hunts, cultural events, and more.

I admit - these do build camaraderie. Just like going to the gym once a quarter builds our body!

While the events help, they are too few and far between to achieve any reasonable result.

I submit - **team building events delay any upcoming attrition at an organization**. That's it. Raising a team's productivity is too far-fetched a goal for these events to be able to achieve.

Given these limitations, we must evaluate our approach.

#### To Be or Not to Be - 'Tis the Question

With all the flaws of bonuses, appraisal systems, or team building systems, do we abandon them?

**I disagree**. Abandoning such systems would create a "socialist" structure. One with no disincentive to be lazy, and no incentive to work hard.

No software company can survive such neglecting techies.

*During Soviet Union times, everyone stood the same risk of going to the Gulags.* ***So, everyone stopped working.***

*You see - when everyone stands the same chance of being imprisoned. Being lazy and sent to Siberia sounds better than working hard and going there!*

*Same would happen at an IT organization.*

The answer then is to redesign the systems with some important characteristics.

This leads us to the core of our discussion.

#### The Pillars of a Cooperation Achieving System

This is where our blog series begins. In the next set of blogs, we talk about pillars of a cooperation achieving system.

As always, I speak only about the tech industry. Let's begin...
