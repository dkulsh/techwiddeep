# Achieve Cooperation | Repetition

How "repeat engagement" affects cooperation at IT companies.

#### Recap

Achieving cooperation and delivering is a priority for IT companies.

As part of this blog series, we look at "systematic" concepts that help achieve cooperation. We've looked at:

- [Detection of behavior](/blog/series/cooperation-part-2/detection-for-cooperation/)
- [Nature of rewards](/blog/series/cooperation-part-2/incentives-for-cooperation/)
- [Clarity](/blog/series/cooperation-part-2/clarity-for-cooperation/)
- [Certainty](/blog/series/cooperation-part-2/certainty-for-cooperation/)
- [Size](/blog/series/cooperation-part-2/size-for-cooperation/)

Today, we discuss repetition to build on these ideas.

#### Repetition

![Repetition Tourist Food](/images/cooperation part 2/repetition-tourist-food.png)

*Why is most food of poor quality at tourist attractions?*

The food is not cheap. In fact, it is sometimes outrageous for the value.

We purchased from a family grocer for almost 40 years!

We received the best quality products, with the best discounts—all without asking!

I am sure you've already figured it out. The key is repetition.

Let's say a restaurant serves a poor meal at Jaipur's Hawa Mahal (*a famous tourist destination*).

- They serve 50 tourists today. They get 50 *new* tourists tomorrow!

Because there is no repeat business, there is hardly any disincentive for today's poor service.

- Let's say I was one of their scapegoats—what am I going to do?

Don't come to the diner again! My chances of visiting the tourism destination are nil either way.

The opposite is also true. Our family grocer had a big disincentive while cheating. He would've lost repeat business.

*PS: Repeat business is so important that it is a success metric!*

The prospect of future losses offsets the temptation to cheat now.

This principle extends beyond everyday examples into professional settings.

#### Tech Companies

The same applies to techies. Continuation of engagement or employment drives quality of work.

- If the organization plans to let me go, then:
  - Rewarding me is an avoidable expense.
  - Penalizing me is an avoidable hassle.

- In the same way, if I plan to move on, then:
  - Incentives are a lucky lottery.
  - Penalties are forgettable mishaps.

In the same breath:

- If I wish to stay with an organization for long, I will avoid cheating and want to deliver.
- If an organization intends to retain me for a length of time, it will avoid cheating and reward well.

Understanding these dynamics helps in evaluating both organizations and employees.

#### Litmus Test

![Repetition Litmus Test](/images/cooperation part 2/repetition-litmus-test.jpg)

Repetition is used as a litmus test across the industry.

##### For an Organization

If an employee has had a lengthy tenure with an organization, then he has almost certainly performed above a threshold. In other words, the lengthy tenure proves:

- Ability to deliver
- Dependability

*Both valuable.*

The lengthy tenure guy had to deliver at some point, whereas the fickle one might've only hopped from one responsibility to another.

Using tenure as the proof—a less talented but loyal employee is more valuable compared to a sharp but unreliable one.

*To employees switching jobs every year:*

*Your experience does not prove your abilities. So—unless you prove talent another way, you are of poor value to an organization.*

*Good organizations will avoid you despite your talent.*

##### For an Employee

If an organization has had lengthy employee tenures, then it has almost certainly done some things right. Therefore, the lengthy tenures prove:

- Good leadership/management
- Care

A reliable but low-paying organization is more desired than a high-paying unreliable one. The good organization had to deliver quality management at some point, whereas the other type of organizations might've simply churned employees.

If business at an organization is expected to grow and if the organization wants to cheat its employees, chances are that it will recognize it stands to lose more in the future due to the collapse of cooperation. Therefore, it will be hesitant to cheat.

*To organizations churning employees:*

*Your total number of years does not prove your standing. So—unless you prove management abilities another way, you are of poor value to an employee.*

*Good employees will avoid you despite your high salaries.*

External factors also influence these repeat engagements.

#### Other Factors - Economy

Other factors like the economy also impact repeat engagement.

During times of economic booms, employees will be tempted to "move on," i.e., end the repeat engagement.

The increased salaries at new organizations give them immediate upside, while the downside hits them only in the future (in case their new organization terminates the employment).

The opposite happens during economic downturns. Employees want to keep the engagement, while organizations dictate their salaries/rewards.

Modern tools have further enhanced the impact of repetition.

#### Review Sites

![Repetition Review Sites](/images/cooperation part 2/repetition-review-sites.png)

Technology has played a big role in creating repetition. Think of review sites—Yelp, Glassdoor, Google reviews, Amazon reviews, Goodreads, etc.

They create a memory of past behavior, thus *giving us repetition* where there was none.

Earlier:

An organization was free to cheat its employees and let them go. The new employees would be a fresh batch of tourists to be cheated again!

Now:

Reviews on Glassdoor create a memory of the cheating. New employees hesitate to join a toxic organization. The organization loses good talent and therefore business.

Essentially, the prospect of a future loss offsets the organization's temptation to make silly decisions now.

Thus, review sites have increased the cost of stupidity by introducing *repetition*.

#### Wrap Up

![Repetition Pillars](/images/cooperation part 2/repetition-pillars.png)

*Repetition* is the last pillar to achieve cooperation at an IT company. Choices between a long-term and a short-term game become very different for the same players.

In the spirit of repetition, once again—these are the six pillars of getting cooperation at an IT organization:

- Quick detection of behavior
- Nature of rewards/punishments
- Clarity
- Certainty
- Size
- Repetition

Missed timelines, delayed projects, stretching programs, over-budgeted portfolios are common—equally so within the IT industry.

While systems like performance reviews, HR practices, rewards, etc., help, any system that misses either of the above pillars becomes dysfunctional.

Hope the clarity helped. Happy team building!
