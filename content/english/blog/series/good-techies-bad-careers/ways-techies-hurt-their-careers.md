## Recap

The best engineers do not always have the best careers. They often miss out on top opportunities, promotions, or assignments.

In previous blogs, we've discussed this phenomenon and explored its causes.

Now, let's examine the impacts of lacking zero-level skills and the benefits of developing them.

To better understand these effects, consider real-world examples from the tech industry.

## English Vinglish

Many Indian college graduates struggle to get jobs due to poor English skills. They excel as techies and pass all technical assessments, yet they are rejected because they cannot converse effectively in the language.

---

We've already talked about Ramesh. He is a great techie with many contributions over the years, serving as a stabilizing factor in the team.

But Ramesh is outright scared of English. When new leadership arrived, our friend did not introduce himself (he would have had to talk in English).

Someone else takes credit for the work he does. No one in the new leadership knows his value addition. He is an unknown worker in a silent corner. Bonuses and promotions do not come his way. I feel this is how things will stay for Ramesh.

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/english-skills-impact.jpg" alt="English Skills Impact" caption="How language barriers can limit career growth" >}}

I know others like Ramesh—poor with English—who were asked to leave the organization. Leadership felt they added little value.

Poor command of language impacts in many ways, from being unable to get a job to losing one.

These language barriers extend beyond job security, affecting daily interactions and team dynamics.

## Dumb and Dumber

Arpan and his tech lead Praveen work at a product-based organization. They are good at their work, often working flexible hours, sometimes pulling all-nighters, and they have great knowledge of the system.

But they have zero dependability.

With all their good qualities, this is a fatal flaw. Any work they complete is assured to be half-baked, broken, untested, and more.

- If they write a piece of code, it's guaranteed to break.
- If they write an integration, rest assured it will stop working.
- If they work on a new project, be confident it will have fatal flaws.

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/dependability-issue.jpg" alt="Dependability Issue" caption="How lack of dependability can undermine technical skills" >}}

Since Arpan and Praveen's work is always broken, management has to bring in troops to cover their failures.

They are so consistent in their poor performance that:

- Managers want to avoid working with them.
- Peers do not like engaging them.
- Leaders always assign someone accountable to keep the project from dying.

One flaw—poor accountability—makes all their good qualities vanish into thin air.

Arpan and Praveen are relevant in the organization, but never in any relevant role.

Beyond dependability issues, emotional control plays a crucial role in career progression.

## Anger Management

Dean was a retired soldier who worked as an analyst.

He helped the tech team understand business needs. The team used that knowledge to develop software with the right understanding. While Dean was out of the military, the military wasn't out of him. His frequent outbursts would be on the lines of...

"You have your head up your a**"

"You dips**ts"

"Morons!" ...and some others.

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/anger-management-example.jpg" alt="Anger Management Example" caption="How anger issues can derail careers" >}}

Obviously, he was never the "go-to" person. There were frequent escalations against him. But the organization let him stay until he retired in his 60s. Seems okay, but is it?

He worked at the same job without promotion for almost 30 years!

Dean's rudeness cost him virtually his whole career (not that he cared).

---

We've talked about Rahul, the Android lead.

Every time someone asked him a question, the first thing they received was an essay of insult. He was the foundation of the organization. But he was only at the foundation too—30 feet below the ground, an unknown entity.

Rahul is too valuable to be punished. At the same time, not valuable enough to be promoted.

What Rahul doesn't realize is that he might retire like Dean in another 30 years.

Building on the theme of communication, politeness can make or break professional relationships.

## Thank You for Smoking

"You don't understand!" said Piyush complainingly.

Ten days later, he was fired.

A confident extrovert, Piyush had joined the team only a week back. Talking to a veteran of the organization, he was trying to explain an issue. Struggling to articulate well enough, he let go of his politeness.

A negative feedback was passed to the leadership. He was asked to leave.

Piyush might have turned out to be a valuable member of the team, but he didn't stay long enough to prove himself. Poor communication (rudeness) was his Achilles' heel.

I hear these during meetings:

- "You don't understand."
- "Did you understand?"

From a subordinate to a supervisor, these sound rude, even when unintentional. How about phrasing the same idea as...

- "Was I able to explain well enough?"
- "Maybe I wasn't able to explain?"

The second way moves the onus of any mistake to oneself. Taking blame away from the listener makes a big difference.

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/communication-politeness.jpg" alt="Communication Politeness" caption="The power of polite communication in professional settings" >}}

The listener suddenly feels more respected, empowered, and opens up. This finesse goes a long way in impressing people and building rapport. A slight change makes a huge impact on the listener.

---

Words are powerful! They can bring one out of trouble or land one into it. 😊

When I first traveled to the USA, one of the things I noticed was the way Americans talked.

- In India, we might say: "Don't do that."
- Americans phrase the same idea as: "I wouldn't do that."

In both cases, the intent is to advise. The second way is less bossy!

Power of words.

---

Babar was a manager in my previous organization. Everyone in the team loved him.

"Our friend isn't too used to working hard," he would complain.

Notice the "our friend" part? Even when critiquing, he was polite. Also, he ensured that the action, not the person, was critiqued.

When someone else was at fault, he would say: "We haven't been able to deliver."

Notice the "we." He made himself part of the group, giving the person at fault companionship.

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/words-power-example.jpg" alt="Words Power Example" caption="How word choice can build or break relationships" >}}

Essentially, Babar was conscious of his words from the listener's perspective. Words were his superpower.

Shifting from verbal skills, physical presentation also influences professional perceptions.

## Beauty and the Beast

Looks have social value.

When Samurai (Japanese warriors) went to battle, they wore armor and masks. One function of the armor was protection. Another was to evoke *fear* in the enemy.

Samurai focused on a purely cosmetic feature during the most serious time—a war, no less. They understood the value of their looks and used it to their advantage.

Coming from a small-town culture, I learned the value of dressing sharp late. When I left my city for college, I observed a disconnect. Simply put, everyone looked *nice*, and I did not.

Only to fit in, I started dressing up. Once I did, people acknowledged me more, and my own confidence boosted.

(I went to a bank in my native town, looking good. The manager himself came over to greet me and get my work done. It had never happened before.)

I was treated like a VIP because I looked like one.

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/dressing-importance.jpg" alt="Dressing Importance" caption="How professional appearance can open doors" >}}

During my work, I observed that some engineers did not get acknowledged, despite being smarter and more hardworking. Some common threads were:

- Shabby, unpolished shoes
- Crumpled clothes
- Unkempt hair
- Unshaven faces

While they were the foundation of amazing systems, they were never invited to client meetings. More presentable colleagues were made the face of success.

The better-looking colleagues got quicker promotions, bigger responsibilities, better networks, and fatter paychecks. Today, some of them hold titles like Vice President and Director in their organizations.

Looks add value!

Also, engineers have an unmentioned perception: Technical work is the only valuable item. Looks don't matter.

Leaders too have an unmentioned perception: Someone who cannot handle minor things like grooming themselves is not mature enough to handle bigger things.

Ten times out of ten, the leader's perception wins!

Presentability is a bottleneck in many engineers' careers.

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/presentability-bottleneck.jpg" alt="Presentability Bottleneck" caption="How appearance can become a career bottleneck" >}}

Beyond appearance, the ability to promote oneself effectively is key to career advancement.

## Selling

"Please don't ignore my post.

I am an experienced ****** ********* with 5+ years of work experience in India.

Situation is worsening day by day and I am almost finished with my savings and also I had a problem of overthinking since I got responsibilities of 4 members of my family.

Desperately looking for a job and ready to join immediately."

Would you hire this guy? What if I told you this is a real message from someone's LinkedIn profile?

Success and opportunities go to people who deserve them, not those who beg for them. Imagine a guy proposing to a girl saying, "Please don't ignore me, but I am desperately looking for a girlfriend!"

With such an opening, the guy would have a lifetime supply of virginity. 😁😁

Selling skills are important.

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/selling-skills-importance.png" alt="Selling Skills Importance" caption="Why selling skills are crucial for career success" >}}

We have been selling all our lives. Do these ring a bell?

- When a guy asks a girl to marry him, he is selling the idea that he will take care of her.
- When priests ask us to behave well, they are selling us the idea of karma and afterlife.
- When kids ask their parents for a video game, they are selling an idea to their parents why the purchase would be a good idea.
- When parents promise their kids chocolate for good behavior, they are selling the worth of the chocolate to the kids.

Sales skills are an important part of our lives. People inept at these skills will suffer.

- Salary negotiations: Companies have a range of salary for each job band. Poor negotiation skills can ensure engineers remain on the lower end of their salary spectrum.
- Complaints/escalations: Life doesn't work in binary. Issues need not be either escalated or resolved. Between an escalation and a resolution, there can be processes, interventions, reprioritization, and more. These are achieved by negotiation and selling skills.
- Leave discussions: Sometimes we are required to pacify anxieties. We sell an idea that our absence won't cause trouble.

Selling, negotiating, and similar skills are essential. People lacking them face troubles.

*PS: I reached out to the LinkedIn guy and informed him that he needs to work on his skills.*

Networking complements selling skills by opening doors to new opportunities.

## The Social Network

Heard of the "PayPal Mafia"?

It refers to the founding members of the team at PayPal. Each one of those folks went on to create great technology companies of their own. Companies like Tesla, SpaceX, YouTube, LinkedIn, Palantir, Yelp, Reddit, Flickr, and Zynga are just a few names from the many that members of the PayPal Mafia went on to create.

If you had been remotely associated with the group, what would your career look like?

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/networking-importance.jpg" alt="Networking Importance" caption="The power of professional networks in career advancement" >}}

Not everyone in the industry works on hard problems or in the right ways. For this reason, having a network is important—sometimes more important than hard work. Naval Ravikant says something on the lines of: *Who you work with and what you work on is more important than how hard you work.*

I just repeat his point.

Social media like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter help us do something very important (not entertainment). These platforms help us build networks. Successful folks in our network might be able to give us a nudge in the right direction. Long-term, the slight nudge might compound into a big one.

Best opportunities come to successful folks first. Having a good network increases one's chances of getting the best opportunities.

Nine times out of ten, a below-average engineer working with the PayPal Mafia will have a better career than a brilliant one working alone.

Who you know is sometimes more important than what you know!

## Do I Have To?

"Do I have to get these skills?" I hear often.

My answer is no. We don't *have to* do anything.

Think of skills as the tires of a car. When all tires are inflated, the car drives well. If the tires are flat, the car will still drive, but with difficulty. The same goes for skills.

I survived without dressing up. But I thrived when I looked sharp. Life became colorful.

We upgrade ourselves when we develop our skills—from a Maruti to a Honda, from a Honda to a Mercedes, from a Mercedes to a Ferrari!

Now, let's explore how a well-rounded skill set benefits professionals in real scenarios.

## On the Other Side

How does the world look for people with a groomed personality? Let's see.

### Country Head

Harsh heads the Asia-Pacific region for a large IT MNC. He has worked with leading organizations like Google in the past.

Interesting point: He moved into the IT industry at the ripe age of 35. He did not know technology, so he learned enough to get him going. What he lacked in tech knowledge, he made up for in hard work, confidence, and social skills.

Harsh understood the value of a rounded personality. Therefore, he upgraded his zero-level skills, like technology, to a minimal standard. Then, he leveraged his strengths.

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/image2.jpg" alt="Country Head Success" caption="How well-rounded skills lead to leadership positions" >}}

Sure, he took time to reach his position. But he is where many regular IT professionals wish to be!

### Lesser Developer

We've talked about Tripti. She is less competent than Ravi but is still with the organization. She was:

- Excellent at communication—both verbal and written
- Good at social skills—negotiation, selling, etc.
- Good at power skills—she knew when and how to charm someone.

She was below par on technology, but her social skills covered up the difference. Last I heard, she was going strong at her organization.

### Absentee Lead

Ranjit is a lead at an organization. He loves to be lazy!

He is late to almost all meetings, doesn't reply to emails, doesn't respond on tickets, and writes buggy code (slang for poor code). But he is really good with power skills. So:

- When a new leader joins, he proactively sells himself.
- When he messes up, he puts in every effort to keep the issue undiscovered.
- When he does something well, he ensures the achievement is highlighted well.

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/image7-1-300x158.jpg" alt="Absentee Lead" caption="How power skills can compensate for other weaknesses" >}}

Ranjit was recently promoted. He is able to slip out of his blunders, hide his mistakes, and showcase his strengths—all because of his power skills.

---

We see that a rounded personality helps:

- Soften the blows
- Slip out of mistakes
- Underplay weaknesses and overplay strengths
- Avoid blind spots... and more.

## Conclusion

A successful career needs multiple skills.

We've seen the drawbacks of zero-level skills on a techie's career. We've also seen the benefits of rounded skills. While some suffer, others use holistic skills as their leverage.

Humans have many intelligences. Some people are good at organizing, others at creativity, and others still at charming. While some are natural abilities, others can be pursued actively.

How to pursue these skills actively—we discuss in the next blog.
