## Introduction

The best engineers do not have the best careers. They do not get the best opportunities, promotions, or assignments.

They might be the horsepower behind an engine, but they remain under-appreciated. Instead, the tier-2 and tier-3 players are the ones who win. This happens often.

This situation is hurtful to techies' careers. It also keeps organizations from utilizing 100% of their team's strength.

As part of this blog series, we will discuss the phenomenon.

To understand why this matters, let's explore its personal impact.

## Why Should You Care?

You work hard.

You work late nights, weekends, and holidays. But you are not rewarded, supposedly because your presentation wasn't good enough. How would you like it?

I don't. This is why you should care!

I've seen engineers...

- Not promoted because of something they said
- Not given opportunities because of their poor dressing
- Not hired because of their bad communication skills

Such mistakes are called blindspots. If you make such mistakes, then you might be missing out on growth and opportunities.

Getting help can be difficult. Most people will either not be qualified to help you or will not want to help.

- Education systems do not prepare students in all skills needed in the real world.

  *(Colleges do not even prepare us for the technical challenges. But critiquing the education system is for another time.)*

- Employers do not have an incentive to help techies.

  If techies outgrow their salary bracket, then they will ask for bigger salaries.

- Friends and family are often not qualified to help us.

  Our close ones are often like us, making the same mistakes and having the same blindspots.

The remaining option is an objective outside perspective. This is what I present here—*perspective*.

Now, let's examine some real-world examples to illustrate this point.

## Doubting Dave

Don't believe me?

Keeping my opinions aside, let me present some facts. The following describes real stories of two engineers from the same team.

### When the Best Sank

Ravi was a good software techie. *(Hope he still is.)*

Like other techies, he had a strength area—UI and UX. He was a self-learner, curious, and hardworking. He took time to come up with ideas, experiment with them, and develop prototypes.

These skills are not found with most developers.

But Ravi had baggage—his ego.

His ego displayed in various forms. He was brash with his seniors, sarcastic to his leads, and demeaning to his peers. He taunted others to do work as good as he did.

While he did write good code, he had excessive pride about it—an inflated sense of self.

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/ego-problem-illustration.jpg" alt="Ego" caption="Ego can be a major career obstacle for talented engineers" >}}

Ravi went on insulting people for some time. HR and leaders heard the issues. But they allowed Ravi to stay because of his tech skills.

One day, the organization had to downsize. Among the list of many incompetent developers was a fantastic techie. Ravi was fired.

### And the Worst Survived

Another techie in the same team was a lesser developer. Let's call her Tripti.

I would call her a downright idiot, but let's just agree that she was less competent than Ravi. Tripti wasn't fired despite the downsizing. This surprised me.

Her characteristics:

- She could not write the simplest of logics or programs.
- She knew virtually nothing about her work despite having worked for at least a few years.
- She had fair communication skills.
- She had fair people skills.

Whenever she wasn't able to finish her work, she took help. Maybe it was her feminine charm or people skills, maybe both. But she mostly got the work done.

That's what matters anyway!

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/successful-colleague-example.jpeg" alt="Girl" caption="Sometimes people skills can compensate for technical weaknesses" >}}

Tripti had gaps in tech skills. But she was able to cover her gaps with her people skills. This has helped her avoid trouble to date.

Last I heard, she was with the same organization.

### What Do We See?

A good developer wasn't able to grow to his potential. At the same time, another one with lesser skills was able to establish herself.

The organization obviously wants to stay efficient and profitable. In that case, Tripti should've been the one let go, and not Ravi.

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/questioning-reality.gif" alt="Question" caption="Questioning the reality of organizational decisions" >}}

**Question:** Was the organization inefficient in identifying the wheat from the chaff?

I have news. Tripti's organization is working and profitable. This is proof that they make some good decisions. To a certain degree, the organization is capable of separating the wheat from the chaff.

**Question:** Could this be the exception rather than the norm?

Better technical minds getting beaten is a common phenomenon. I've known MNCs, small to mid-level startups, private practices, freelancers, and dozens of techies.

**Question:** Perhaps I am biased towards one versus the other?

Far from it. The blog is not a criticism of Tripti or techies like her. It's recognition of the fact that she survived without technical skills. She must have some other skills that aren't commonly acknowledged.

Building on these stories, let's see how the narrative unfolded further.

## Story Continues

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/story-continuation.jpeg" alt="Story Book" caption="The story continues with deeper insights" >}}

After Ravi was let go, I kept in touch with him. I had worked with him and wanted to help him. During our conversations, I observed a surprising behavior. Ravi fully blamed the organization for him being let go. In his mind, he was an ideal employee and wasn't fit to have been a part of the leaving club *(people who were fired were not the brightest)*.

I wanted to help Ravi understand how his ego hurt him. But a hurt egoistic person is not open to feedback. Also, I did not have a good way of explaining his ego barrier to him.

I mean, how do you explain to someone with a big ego that he has a big ego?

Until one day I read a Farnam Street blog. Eureka! I found a *mental model* for explaining the problem without hurting Ravi's ego. That moment, this blog series was conceived.

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/eureka-moment.png" alt="Eureka" caption="The eureka moment that led to this blog series" >}}

The information should help you understand what happened to Ravi and what happens to many others.

Now, let's shift to some broader opinions on this topic.

## Time for Opinions

Think of the differences between Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. Tesla, a much better engineering mind, died broke and penniless in the end. Edison, on the other hand, owned a big corporation, still creating value for the world today.

This is not to say that Edison was anything less than a genius. Heck, I don't even qualify to rate him. What I mean is: At times, *best people fail and the second or third best people succeed in the real world*.

This happens because of *blindspots*. If you have learned to drive a car in India, then you are less likely to understand the term *blindspot*.

*Driving tip: In Indian roads are our "baap ki jayedaad" (ancestral property). It belongs to us, and so we don't have blindspots.*

Jokes aside, what happens is—between the rearview mirror and the sideview mirror, there is a gap. This gap cannot be seen from either of the two mirrors and is called a blindspot.

If another vehicle is in the blindspot area, then despite checking both mirrors, I will not see the vehicle. I might mistakenly turn towards the vehicle, causing an accident. The only way to see the other vehicle is to "turn one's neck" and look at the blindspot area (through the rear seat window).

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/blindspot-concept.jpg" alt="Blindspot" caption="Understanding blindspots in career development" >}}

*Blindspot* as a term has become synonymous with mistakes we make without realizing the consequences they create *(because we cannot see the consequence)*.

As part of this blog series, I intend to help techies see their blindspots.

To guide you through this, here's the planned sequence.

## Sequence

We divide the blog series into three parts:

1. Understand
2. Impacts to techies and their careers
3. What to do

I will consider myself successful when any layman from the IT industry understands the material easily.

Before diving in, a quick note on the intent.

## Disclaimer

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/disclaimer-icon.png" alt="Disclaimer Image" caption="Important disclaimer about the series intent" >}}

The intent is to help people see the chinks in their armor, not to look down upon others. I do not consider myself better than the ones I critique.

Also, I share my truth and not the truth of all others. This truth might cause discomfort but needs to be tasted for one's growth.

Let's get going!

Write back in case you have an opinion. Like what you read—do like, comment, and share.
