## Recap

The best engineers do not have the best careers. They do not get the best opportunities, promotions, or assignments.

In the previous blogs, we have discussed the phenomenon, understood the cause, and seen the different impacts.

Now, let's explore some remedies to the problem. The following is more a guideline than a map. I share what I can, with an open hand for help, to whoever asks.

To better address these remedies, we first need to examine our underlying beliefs.

## Garbage in, Garbage Out

Heard these before?

*"It is inside what matters"*

*"Managers are just suits and ties"*

Before we discuss what to do, let's understand why we do what we do.

All of us have beliefs that shape our world around us. These perceptions are painted by our culture, upbringing, education, experiences, and more. Beliefs like...

- Salesmen are pushy and manipulative.
- Rich people are crooks.
- "Don't judge a book by its cover" (meaning try not judging only by the presentation).
- It is okay to be late (in many cultures).

We might hold these perceptions despite facts like:

- While some salesmen might be pushy, others are a pleasure to be around.
- Many rich folks are honest and hardworking.
- Books are always judged by their cover. We look at people and form first opinions based on looks.
- Being late is just that—being late. Not the biggest sin, but it also equals not keeping one's commitment.

Explaining visually...

Some folks have red-colored experiences in life. They see the world like the image on the left.

Some folks have blue-colored experiences in life. They see the world like the image on the right.

The third image is what the world is like!

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/beliefs-perception-right.png" alt="Beliefs Perception Right" caption="Different experiences lead to different perspectives" >}}

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/reality-perception.jpg" alt="Reality Perception" caption="The actual reality that we often miss" >}}

*Your personal experiences make up maybe 0.00000001% of what's happened in the world but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.*

People [believe what they've seen](http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/were-all-out-of-touch/) happen exponentially more than what they read about has happened to other people, if they read about other people at all.

We're all biased to our own personal history. Everyone.

(Farnam Street) [ideas-that-changed-my-life](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/ideas-that-changed-my-life/)

Our beliefs shape our worldview. They influence our actions. The actions in turn bring results. As an example:

- I might believe that the stock market is risky. Thinking so, I will not invest my money into the market. My money will stay in the bank and will depreciate based on inflation rate.
- Someone might believe that the stock market is not risky. They will invest all their money into the market. The investment might grow fast, but it might have a risk of total failure.
- Someone else still might know stock market risks but consider them mitigatable. He might make calculated risk investments. This might result in slow but steady growth.

**Same reality has three different perceptions. Each perception brings a different course of action. Each action has its own outcome.**

In the IT industry, beliefs might look like:

- Managers are just suits and ties. Meaning—the only value a manager adds is that of presentation. Since the value of presentation is less than the value of doing work, the manager is less than an engineer. An engineer with such a belief will sabotage his chances of getting a promotion.
- "What's inside matters." Translating to—what is outside doesn't matter. Looking sharp is not the most important thing. Doing good work is. Someone with such a belief will not put in effort toward looking good.
- IITans do startups. Only students from Tier-1 colleges can go high up in the corporate hierarchy. Techies with such beliefs will not attempt to push beyond their usual boundaries.
- Life should be fun. Translating to not taking risks or not putting in backbreaking work, since these will spoil the fun. Such an engineer will not work hard.

As we see, our beliefs sometimes limit us from achieving more.

I write this blog on a MacBook Pro. This machine is a good example for our discussion.

My laptop has less memory, fewer CPU cores, and less RAM than many machines in the marketplace. If only "what is inside" mattered, then MacBooks should've been a substandard product. But the experience of working on a Mac is so much better than using other laptops.

Since the outside experience is better, *what is inside doesn't matter to me*.

With the above in mind, allow me to put forth some realities from the tech industry.

- Looks matter. A sharp-looking person evokes confidence. A shabby-looking one doesn't. Subconsciously, people think: *"His good looks are a signal that he attends to small things. If he attends to small things, he is more suited to attend to big ones."*

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/looks-matter-reality.jpg" alt="Looks Matter Reality" caption="Why appearance matters in professional settings" >}}

- English language matters. Technology is international. English provides the bridge between nations and cultures. An engineer with poor English will struggle to communicate well. Poor communication will eclipse many skills.
- Being "the face" is important. More people know Steve Jobs and fewer know Steve Wozniak. This despite the fact that Wozniak might've contributed more to technology within Apple than Jobs. The term "face value" is exactly that. People remember faces more than an out-of-sight genius.
- Selling matters. We are all into "non-sales selling" now. Here is what a big part of a techie's day looks like.
  - Negotiating timelines.
  - Negotiating salary and bonuses (appraisal discussions).
  - Selling an architecture or design (design discussions).
All of the above require selling skills. Someone poor at these will take big blows to his work life.

**Faulty perceptions create bad results.**

Poor looks, bad communication, etc., are ways by which techies themselves create situations they say they don't want.

So, the next time we techies feel judgmental about someone, let's pause our judgment and play our curiosity. Maybe we'll figure that it is less of the other person and more of us.

Building on this understanding of perceptions, let's explore how to adopt better habits by observing successful individuals.

## Be a Good Copier

I have found that an easy way of avoiding blind spots is by copying the right people. Keyword: right people.

Try looking at successful people in the fields of business, education, news, government, armed forces, etc. From an Indian perspective, try looking at Harsha Bhogle, Ravi Shastri, Narendra Modi, Mukesh Ambani, Tatas, General Narvane, etc.

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/successful-people-characteristics.jpg" alt="Successful People Characteristics" caption="Learning from successful people across different fields" >}}

Here are the common characteristics I see...

- Grooming
  - Have crisp haircuts.
  - Are clean-shaven or have a well-groomed beard/mustache.
  - Are dressed smartly, mostly in formal clothing. Might be sometimes in casuals but not at the compromise of looks.
- Good communication skills
  - They are skilled in their language—whatever it might be.
  - Skilled in the different mediums of communication—verbal, written, or otherwise.
  - They talk confidently.
  - Introverts or extroverts—they speak when needed.
You might've heard Ravi Shastri's or Harsha Bhogle's commentary. An army general might not have the same flair for dramatics, but his communication will get the job done nevertheless.
- High-energy individuals
  - They seem pumped up, rain or shine.
  - They speak loud and clear, reflecting their energy levels.
  - Their posture is upright.
During PM Modi's first term, he went on many foreign trips. Upon landing, many journalists were tired of the long trip, but Modi seemed energetic. (Without political affiliations) Point is—successful people are high-energy individuals.
- Other characteristics
  - Good social skills. Successful people know that success comes from being good with people.
  - They are learners. They educate themselves through mentors, books, experiences, and more.
  - They have high accountability. Once they say something will be done, it usually gets done.
  - They take educated risks. They are willing to experiment and be wrong sometimes. At the same time, they do not take outrageous risks.

If we were to improve our dressing, communication, accountability, etc., would we become a better version of ourselves? Of course!

This is the reason the idea of copying the right people works.

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/copying-right-people.jpg" alt="Copying Right People" caption="The value of learning from successful role models" >}}

But, as we say in Hindi—"Nakal ke lie akal" please!

The phrase roughly translates to: Common sense is required even for copying.

The idea of copying is to learn from them and not become them. When I recommend dressing up, I do not recommend shopping Armani or Gucci (please don't go on a shopping spree only to file bankruptcy). Instead, I intend to promote looking sharp. It can be done within your budget.

Similarly, learn English with common sense. Please don't start saying "Dad/Mom" instead of "Papa/Mummy," "Appa/Ammi," etc. (you might get slapped into making corrections).

Also, if Kareena Kapoor (famous Indian actress) is a level 10 on dressing, you might not need to be at her level. Heck, I wouldn't want to be at level 8; it's too bloody boring.

At the same time, I simply do not want to be a level 0 on my presentations. Remember:

Zero dressing × all my personality = zero results!

So, the next time you want to get better, look at the best and learn from them.

Before implementing these changes, it's important to reflect on your personal approach to transformation.

## Before the Change

I am poor at taking on huge tasks. My motivation doesn't carry me through. But when I break a big task into small ones, I am able to generate results. I have also observed that most people are like me. Some aren't, too. Some people love taking on big tasks.

Before you start making the changes, make an attempt to understand which category you fit in. Then, start making the change.

Also, I would not make too many changes at once. Humans have limited energy. We need to learn to focus until one skill gets cooked. Only then move on to cooking the next one.

So, skill up, one skill at a time.

But again, this is just me. Are you a full-thrust propeller? Or are you a step-by-step guy like me? Maybe you're a hybrid!

Square pegs for square holes and round ones for round holes. Choose the method that suits your personality.

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/change-approach.png" alt="Change Approach" caption="Understanding your personal approach to change" >}}

With this self-awareness in place, let's dive into the actual process of change.

---

## The Change

*"Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching."*

Naval Ravikant

Active participation enhances learning. Meaning...

- Speaking English is the best way to improve spoken English.
- Grooming oneself is the best way to improve one's dressing.
- Active listening improves people skills.

I mentioned that small changes work well for me. As an example, here is my path to getting healthier:

- Wake up early, for 2 weeks. That's it.
- Next 2 weeks: Got up early + went for a short walk. I did not have running shoes, did not have a track suit, had no clue about warm-ups. My shorts, my chappals... Me and... Pawri ho rahi thi! (a vlog reference)
- Next 2 weeks: Got up early + went for a short walk + 100 m jogging. My body suddenly hurt too much, and I realized that I was missing warm-ups. 5 YouTube videos later... I was ready with my warm-up plan.
- Next 2 weeks: Got up early + stretching exercises + mix of jogging and walking. This is when I asked a marathoner about what is needed to run. Bought a pair of Nikes.

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/gradual-improvement-example.jpg" alt="Gradual Improvement Example" caption="How gradual changes lead to sustainable improvement" >}}

I run 5 km daily. But I haven't researched any training technique till date!

Taking action took me farther as compared to researching. So, start speaking English today! And research learning methods tomorrow. Attend to your looks today, and worry about fashion trends tomorrow.

*"A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week."*

George Patton

While I advise you to be mindful of your change preferences, do not take an eternity to get started.

As Nike says... just do it.

Once you've begun making changes, persistence is key to seeing results.

## After the Change

Gold mining has a concept called "vein." In hard rock deposits, gold occurs in narrow lines. These lines are referred to as veins or a vein of gold. Veins can be separated from each other by several feet.

Napoleon Hill's book *Think and Grow Rich* talks about a young man. The man was mining gold and had lost a vein. He gave up digging any further, sold his equipment, and walked away. The scrap dealer who bought the equipment was aware of vein formations and started digging again. The next vein was just 3 feet away.

The young man gave up "3 feet from gold"; hence the expression.

Skills don't cook like 5-minute noodles or instant upma. They are more like the delicious kheer that needs to be simmered for hours.

While we make changes, let's be patient for results to show up. Let's not quit 3 feet from gold!

{{< figure src="/images/good-techies-bad-careers/patience-results.jpg" alt="Patience Results" caption="The importance of patience in skill development" >}}

### Follow-Up

The internet has opened the world to us. Knowledge on almost every subject is available around us. Apps to track our habits, books to coach on subjects, blogs, vlogs, university courses that are either free or priced minimally. Let's leverage this availability.

Also, tracking progress is important for growth. But certain skills cannot be measured, e.g., mindfulness, listening abilities, etc.

I have found that these skills are more difficult to learn and more valuable. Mindfulness is not taught in college because it cannot be graded. But not having a grading system does not mean we should not learn these skills. We still own that responsibility. So, measure or no measure, we ought to march on.

Beyond personal efforts, the surroundings we choose can significantly influence our progress.

## Environment

*"Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. We tend to believe our habits are a product of our motivation, talent, and effort. Certainly, these qualities matter. But the surprising thing is, especially over a long time period, your personal characteristics tend to get overpowered by your environment."*

James Clear

As an Indian, when I traveled abroad, I observed some immediate environment change effects.

- Drinking. Folks who shied from drinking in India showed off beer stocks in refrigerators in the USA.
Alcohol is seen as a social vice in India. Drinking is done in a socially hidden manner, away from parents, neighbors, and others that might judge us. Facebook posts about whiskey or tweets about beer are socially disliked. The USA has more social acceptance to drinking.
- Littering. Indians litter streets every day. In the United States, the same people suddenly became mindful of not littering.

Same people—in different environments—immediate behavioral changes.

If our environment influences our behaviors, then we can choose our environments to help us develop a desired behavior too.

- If I want to learn communication skills, I could join a debate club.
- If I want to be a speaker or teacher, I could join the Toastmasters club.
- I can become friends with someone good at power skills.
- If I want to improve my English, I can watch English music, news, sports commentary, movies, and channels.

Remember our mom's saying: Hang around the good kids. Environment matters, and mom knows!

To wrap up these insights, let's consider the overall impact on a techie's career.

## Conclusion

T. Harv Eker says something on the lines of: *"If someone has a leaky bucket, then no matter how much water might be put in the bucket with the best possible efficiency, the water will finally drain away."*

Missing skills are like holes in a techie's bucket. Technology might fill the bucket with lots of water, but holes will drain all the water away.

This blog series was to help techies understand how they contribute to their own failures—to help make the invisible hand visible.

In the beginning of the series, I mentioned that I would consider my information successful when a layman techie is able to understand the material easily.

Coming to the end, I hope I have measured up to my own standards.

Write back in case you have an opinion. Like what you read—do like, comment, and share.
