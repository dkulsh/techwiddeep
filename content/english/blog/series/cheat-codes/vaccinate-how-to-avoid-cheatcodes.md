#### Recap

Some people thrive at tech companies without doing any meaningful work. They cheat their way through. As part of the blog series, we discuss this phenomenon.

Such people use tricks to game the system. We refer to these tricks as cheatcodes.

![Cheatcode Image](/images/cheat-codes/vaccinate-avoid/cheat-codes-cover.png)

Until now, we've talked about:

- Various forms of cheatcodes
- Reasons they thrive at software organizations
- Losses cheatcodes create

Now we discuss how to avoid the cheatcode culture from getting established.

Cheatcodes can take many forms. So, the below list is more of a recommendation set than a solution template. User discretion is advised.

Let's get prepared!

To build a strong foundation, let's start with the importance of awareness.

#### Awareness

Let us recall the "Invisible Ships" phenomenon. Natives weren't able to see the first Europeans coming to their lands. Once natives realized that people can float on water, they were able to see the incoming fleets.

Similarly, by knowing that cheatcoding is real, we take the first step towards preventing the problem.

![Invisible Ships Image](/images/cheat-codes/vaccinate-avoid/invisible-ships.jpg)

The city of Troy did not imagine that the wooden horse standing outside could house invasive forces. The concept of such trickery did not register in their minds. This led to their downfall.

Be aware that there is a cheatcode trojan trying to gain entry into your system. Simple awareness will help organizations put checks to stop any such intruders.

I was once almost hired by an organization. The CTO (Chief Tech Officer) explained the challenges their team faced:

"Our techies are very smart and they tend to fool any manager who is not really technical. Therefore, we want to hire a hardcore techie as their manager!"

The CTO was *aware* of the cheatcode problem. Once he realized that his techies were fooling their manager, he fired the old MBA manager and started working on hiring someone who could manage the cheatcode problem.

Another manager might've tried:

- Motivating the team
- Pressuring the team to perform (the pressure inevitably only lands on the best/most responsible folks in the team). The few pillars
- Enticing them by salary/bonus benefits
- Firing some people
- Other stupid shit

Such solutions do not work or work to the benefit of the cheatcoder.

To avoid the cheatcode menace, the first thing we can do is to be *aware* of the phenomenon.

Building on awareness, the next step is to enhance visibility within the organization.

#### Make the Invisible Visible

Information technology is virtual in nature. Since software exists in the virtual world, humans are not naturally equipped to evaluate technology.

To lessen the disadvantage, organizations can:

##### Display Tech Details (Make Visible - Literally)

**True story:**

An organization newly implemented a CI/CD pipeline. It's a fancy word for automatic code release (Continuous Integration Continuous Deployment).

Engineers were not habitual to using the new technology: the CI/CD pipeline. So, they brought up tricks to avoid using the new tool. Result: code quality was only "slightly" better than before the tool was used.

A new lead came in. He started publishing the failure rates of each programmer's code across the organization. Within the next 10 days, failure rates fell from around 80% to less than 20%. Eventually reaching less than 5% after another month.

![Failure Rates Image](/images/cheat-codes/vaccinate-avoid/failure-rates.png)

What changed?

A big red line showed across an engineer's name. Individual failures which were hidden till now were suddenly on display for the whole organization.

His friends started poking him during coffee times, his managers gave him the "looks," the directors joked around him. Humans are social animals. Most of us will go the extra mile to secure our status. That is what happened.

Failed programs, error reports, emails, messages existed in the virtual world. This virtual data was suddenly available for everyone to see in red, green, and yellow. But we are equipped to evaluate visual cues.

Therefore, visual cues will change behavior. This is a form of increasing transparency.

The problem withered away without any external pressure or any disincentives. No developer lost any bonus or worked more than normal hours.

Organizations can make the "invisible" visible. This will avoid cheatcode issues from creeping up.

##### Encourage Visibility/Transparency

![Transparency Image](/images/cheat-codes/vaccinate-avoid/transparency.jpg)

Organizations designed on a factory system give visibility in one direction. Only the supervisor knows about the subordinate's work. Also, the visibility is 1-2 layers deep. Supervisor does not know about subordinates further down the chain. And subordinates do not know the work the supervisor does.

This creates opacity across a system. Software is a virtual product. Opacity around an already virtual product is bad.

I recommend:

- **Display deliverables.**

  All team members should have clear and displayed work. My subordinates and superiors should know the work I do.

  If *everyone knows*, then I might easily get caught. I will be discouraged from using any cheatcode tricks. Therefore, transparency increases accountability.

- **Guarantee security.**

  Everyone is troubled by dictators. But no one wants to bell the cat! Because no one wants to become a martyr.

  Same goes for cheatcoders. Everyone wants to highlight cheatcode issues, but no one wants to face the side-effects of doing so. Unless individuals are assured of their job security, they will not come up to highlight cheatcode issues.

- **Free communication.**

  Once security has been handled, the following can be done.

  - "Skip level" meetings.

    A subordinate "skips" his boss from the meeting and meets his boss's boss or someone even higher up. This helps the individual bring up any cheatcode issues related to his supervisors.

  - All-round feedback.

    Allowing feedback to superiors and peers, not just to subordinates.

  - Freedom to point out...

    - An inefficiency
    - Vague deliverables
    - Below-par performance

  Free communication builds a self-correcting system. Such a system does not allow itself to fall below standards.

- **No/very few "Sacred Cow" topics.**

![Sacred Cow Image](/images/cheat-codes/vaccinate-avoid/sacred-cow.jpg)

  An organization was known for its "open" culture. Techies were encouraged to ask questions. Only problem: we could discuss requirements and designs till the cows came home. But talking about people was a "sacred cow" subject.

  If a topic is protected, then it will receive less feedback. The topic will be easily abused. It will have less chances of improvement.

Increasing transparency is logical; it seems simple. But beware: it is a lot of hard work. First reactions are to resist transparency, especially in patriarchal cultures or long-established systems.

Superiors are not accountable to subordinates at most places. This is an established habit. Adopting new habits is discomforting and takes effort.

The idea of transparency is to both *discourage cheatcodes* and *allow the visibility of a cheatcode as soon as possible*, from any layer within an organization.

With visibility in place, it's crucial to address issues at their core.

#### Dig to the Root

**True story:**

During one of my projects, I was bombarded with requests. Analysis requests, meetings, ad hoc messages, tech groomings, story discussions, and more. The situation got overwhelming.

Truth be told, I believed that some team members weren't putting their best foot forward. After taking time to calm down, I backward-reasoned the problem. Here it is...

![Problem Reasoning Image](/images/cheat-codes/vaccinate-avoid/problem-reasoning.png)

Is "too many questions" the root cause of the problem or just the symptom? Should people stop asking questions?

I found out that *lack of information* was the root cause.

- Client team did not understand technology
- Tech team did not understand business
- Testing team understood neither
- Tech partners understood pieces

![Team Understanding Image](/images/cheat-codes/vaccinate-avoid/team-understanding.png)

No one person in the team really understood the end-to-end picture, except myself (with humility). The overall responsibility fell on my shoulders.

Since the problem was lack of information, the solution was a big training session.

I conducted a big training session. Next thing I see:

- Well-articulated business requests
- Well-explained tech problems
- Most problems sorted by someone within the team
- Very few requests coming my way
- Requests that came to me deserved to be there!

This was a big turnaround for a single KT session.

The turnaround proved something I felt was true: problems are sometimes "symptoms" of the real problems (better explained in the book called *Principles*).

All problems came my way because people initiating the problems did not know any better. The only person they knew could help was me. *People weren't lazy, just ignorant.*

So, training and not reprimanding was the solution.

This is what happens at tech organizations. Most problems are symptoms of a deeper problem. We need to dig to the root of the problem.

In cheatcode context, this might look like...

- Poor code -> causing -> Too many issues
- Poor requirements -> causing -> Poor code
- New team member -> causing -> Poor requirements
- **Lack of training** -> causing -> New team member's poor requirements
- **Poor supervision** -> causing -> Poor requirements

![Root Causes Image](/images/cheat-codes/vaccinate-avoid/root-causes.png)

Root causes turn out to be: lack of training and poor supervision.

Therefore, the solution is to train the new team member and fix the lethargic manager. Hard-hitting programmers will simply not solve the problem.

Similarly, a technical issue might really be:

- A deployment problem and therefore a DevOps issue
- A vague requirement and therefore the BA's fault
- A poor design and therefore the architect's shortcoming
- A missed feature and therefore the lead's shortfall, or
- Lack of domain understanding, therefore leadership's gap in coaching the team

*Learn to dig to the root of problems. It will lead you to the cheatcoders.*

##### Listen

Cheatcoders create trouble for others. Some folks facing such troubles will always bring the issues forward, sometimes at their own peril.

Mostly, the aptitude to recognize the issue will be lacking. This brings us to the next point: listen.

![Listen Image](/images/cheat-codes/vaccinate-avoid/listen.jpg)

Simple objective listening goes a long way. It helps in understanding the issues, resolving them, and avoiding them in the future.

Cheating is beneficial only when not getting caught. If chances of getting reported are high, then it's a disincentive for me to cheat. I will end up:

1. Quitting the team
2. Quitting lethargy

Either way, the organization wins.

Listening is a simple and useful tool. It helps keep cheatcoders away.

To further deter poor performance, ensure everyone has a stake in the outcomes.

#### Skin in the Game

Nassim Taleb wrote a book by the same name. The book explains the concept in detail.

![Skin in the Game Image](/images/cheat-codes/vaccinate-avoid/skin-in-game.png)

Loosely, the phrase means someone doing work should have a disincentive for doing it poorly. Let's apply it to our situation.

Cheatcoding is lucrative until there is no punishment for doing poor-quality work. If my mess can be cleaned up by others, I will be happy.

Real examples:

1. A lead writes poor code. Developers fix the resulting issues.
2. A manager misses requirements. Tech team has to burn the midnight oil.
3. An architect misses an auditing system. Developers lose their bonuses.
4. A programmer wastes time. He asks for help at the nth hour. Others have to pitch in the name of "teamwork."

If another person needs to solve my issues, then the cheatcoder is encouraged.

What is your opinion about the below scenarios?

- If a programmer's code has issues, then he needs to stretch late nights to fix his code.
- If the testing team misses a bug, then they need to face the flak.
- If a director's team delivers poor code, he should lose his bonus.
- If a manager's team gives poor requirements or plans work poorly, then the manager should lose his promotion.

Skin in the game immediately creates a disincentive for poor-quality work. Therefore, it discourages cheatcoding.

Finally, apply fundamental principles to guide your approach.

#### Common Sense

Anyone working with a tech team needs to understand certain simple "common sense" ideas.

![Common Sense Image](/images/cheat-codes/vaccinate-avoid/common-sense.jpg)

1. **Technical work requires technical supervision.**

   A saying in Hindi goes "*Jiska kaam usi ko sajhe, aur kare to danda baaje*." Loosely translates to: Person suited for the job is the best person to do the work; others are almost certain to mess up.

   Managing technical work requires a deep understanding of technology. Superficial knowledge does not help. Techies will be able to fool anyone not tech enough. Also, someone familiar with the work will easily recognize any inefficiencies.

   When people with fancy qualifications but little knowledge of technology are asked to manage a tech team, they create a mess. Techies are able to easily cheat. More complex the technical work, the easier cheating becomes.

   Allow a techie to manage technical work.

2. **Value of business practices.**

   Business practices are tools for getting the work done, and not the work itself. They need to be valued as such.

   - The chef sharpens his knife instead of using it to cut the vegetables. If you were at his restaurant, how would you enjoy the scene?
   - The plumber oils the suction pump instead of using it to clear the clog. As the employer, would you be happy?

   Meetings are frequent and valued at tech organizations. I hold nothing against meetings. They are enablers to produce code. At the same time, meetings are not deliverables themselves. Same goes for all business practices.

   More leaders ought to realize that requirement documents, software lifecycles, deployment tools are just tools to deliver the code. The tools aren't the deliverables. Code is!

3. **Vague for managers, clear for techies.**

   Engineering work does not prosper with ambiguity.

   Ideas start vaguely. They become loose business requirements. Business analysts, managers, and architects are responsible for translating the vague business requirements to clear tech requirements. Doing so is the crux of their job.

   If techies are given vague requirements (unfortunately happens a lot), the resulting code will always be half ready. Also, techies will be easily able to cheat the work.

   Clear concrete work with fixed timelines will keep most (if not all) techies accountable.

#### Conclusion

We wanted to learn about vaccinating oneself (COVID-time vocab) from the cheatcode virus. We discussed many practices, starting with simply being aware, to being clear and using common sense.

These practices will keep most teams healthy!

But once someone has been infected, a vaccine is no longer sufficient. They need a dose of medicine. This is what we do in the next blog.

In the final blog of the series, we discuss the antidote for an already infected organization.

Let's go...
