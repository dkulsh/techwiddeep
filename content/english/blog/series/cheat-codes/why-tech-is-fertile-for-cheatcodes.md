#### Recap

Some people thrive at tech companies without doing any meaningful work. They cheat their way through. As part of the blog series, we discuss this phenomenon.

Such people use tricks to game the system. We refer to these tricks as cheatcodes.

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/why-tech-fertile/cheat-codes-cover.png)

In the previous blog, cheatcodes have been explained. In this blog, we will talk about "why" cheatcodes exist at software companies. Also, why the software industry has more cheatcoders compared to other industries.

Let's get started.

To better understand this, let's explore how these cheatcodes might fare in other sectors.

#### Cheating in Another Industry

Let's exercise our imaginations. Let us use software industry cheatcodes in some other industries, such as farming, construction, or finance.

1. *Late night emails*

How about a farm laborer sends the owner a late night text message? As a farm owner, my first question would be: "Can I get some of what you are smoking?"

2. *Meeting-ophilia*

My house is under construction. The contractor tells me that he had "met" the suppliers and "discussed" prices and more. What would be important to me?

- The contractor had "discussed" the prices? Or
- "Seeing" the walls come up?

3. *Postmanship*

My stock broker charges a hefty fee. He simply forwards me information from the mutual fund house. What would I prefer?

- A direct fund investment? Or
- One via my broker?

The same goes for a property dealer. If the property dealer simply forwards information, then would I pay him 1% of the property value?

Cheatcodes that thrive in the IT industry would be non-starters in many other industries. I hope this is obvious. This brings us to the next question.

Why is the tech industry a fertile ground for so many cheatcodes?

I mean really! Pause reading any further. Take a minute to think about it. Bring in your inputs before you read any further.

Building on this contrast, let's examine the fundamental nature of what tech companies produce.

#### Nature of the Ware

The answer to the above question begins with another question: What do software companies produce?

I hope you said "software"!

Let's follow up the answer with yet another question (looks like a question loop already!):

- How much does software weigh?
- Does it sound melodious or plain?
- What color would software have?
- Would it taste bland, bitter, or sour?
- Would bad software smell pungent or fruity?
- Would software feel greasy or silky?

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/why-tech-fertile/software-evaluation.jpg)

I hope you weren't able to answer any of the above questions. Obviously, the next question is:

*How would we evaluate software?*

This is the starting point of our discussion.

Wine, a dish, a piece of marble, a car, an egg, and other things exist in the real world. Software exists in the virtual world.

Thus, *none of the five human senses—touch, smell, see, taste, and hear—help us evaluate software. This puts us at an immediate disadvantage.*

*Humans are not designed to evaluate software, a software engineer, or the work toward building software.*

Software exists in the form of electrons or photons floating inside microprocessors. The microprocessors are inside computers. Computers might be on the cloud, thousands of miles away. The nature of software (virtual) puts humans at a disadvantage for evaluating it.

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/why-tech-fertile/virtual-world.jpg)

Most of us might agree to the above idea, but few will really understand what's going on. So, allow me some examples.

Ever seen the movie *Inception* or *Matrix*?

The movies depict a virtual world. This world has rules. Few rules were unchangeable, but most were changeable!

Changeable rules were up to the architect, designer, or planner to be added, changed, or removed.

In the movie *The Matrix*, imagine a city where everyone owns a bus and not a car or bike.

Let's imagine a typical morning:

- People driving buses to buy bread and milk.
- Kids going to school in their parents' buses.
- Adults going to their offices, each in their own bus.

Would normal road infrastructure support such traffic?

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/why-tech-fertile/bus-traffic-analogy.jpg)

This is what happens within software (performance issues).

In the real world, people would see that the road infrastructure would never support the traffic. Someone would raise an objection very soon. But looking inside a virtual world requires skills, experience, time, and energy.

Result: Bandwidth or latency issues within applications or websites.

In the movie *Inception*, what if sewage pipelines are laid 50 feet above the ground?

The system would be inefficient, but most times it would work fine. However, a single fault will spray shit (literally) all over the place. (While disgusting) This is what happens within software.

Sometimes the design allows data corruption.

In the real world, if someone were to see the pipelines, they would raise an objection very soon. However, the ability to look inside software code requires skills, experience, time, and energy.

*The real world has bound rules and tangible results. The software industry has very few rules and, more importantly, a virtual end product.*

Software deals with abstract concepts in a virtual world. And because the world is virtual, individuals can design and change almost anything. The cost of investigating software can be very high. This allows cheatcoders easy access to claiming east while going west!

Cheating is easy in the IT industry. Hopefully, this first reason explains why. If not, let's connect over coffee.

Lots to digest here. Take a walk before we consume more! Next, we'll explore the processes involved in creating this virtual product.

#### Production Practices

We have looked at the nature of software. Now let's look at the production system itself, i.e., the practices used to develop software.

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/why-tech-fertile/production-practices.png)

Product companies use manufacturing systems like assembly lines, supply chains, and inventory management. Similarly, software companies use systems to produce software. These systems are called production lifecycles. Each system has multiple steps.

Fancy words (Agile, Waterfall, etc.) can be used to describe each system. Regardless, these are the basic real steps that go into the development of software.

1. Gathering business requirements - *produces business requirements*
2. Translating business req. to tech specifications - *produces tech requirements*
3. Analysis - *produces feasibility doc*
4. High level design - *produces high level design*
5. Detailed design - *produces detail design doc*
6. Coding/programming - *produces code*
7. Testing - *produces results*
8. Deployment - *produces working software*

Simplifying the above list for a layman:

1. Business requirements - *are words*
2. Tech requirements - *are words*
3. Feasibility doc - *are words*
4. High level design - *is words or a complex/boring diagram*
5. Detail design doc - *complex words*
6. Code - *invisible code of course!*
7. Testing results - *more words, numbers, and sometimes a chart*
8. Working software - *working application*

Enticing enough?

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/why-tech-fertile/word-intensive-process.jpg)

*Humans are designed for audio/visual cues, and not words. This is how evolution designed humans.* (I realize the irony with the length of my blog here :D).

This also means that mostly, my lengthy emails will escape scrutiny. A cheatcode opportunity! #*obscurityByLanguage*

Also, words are very momentary, fading, fleeting, ephemeral. This is the nature of words. How many conversations from today do you remember "word for word"?

Exactly my point.

I will miss something even when I try my best. I will not remember "all" requirements, designs, or code for any project. I don't remember what I ate for breakfast today! And that applies to any number of times you read this blog. (By the way, I am pretty good at my job.)

Sometimes words are documented. Even then, they are easy to be "interpreted" per one's bias or convenience.

Today's world has project management software like Jira. There was a time when this software did not exist. During those times:

- Understanding a requirement differently was easy.
- Changing the acceptance criteria was easy.
- Changing the scope was easy.
- Changing the schedule was easy.

Doing the above is still easy, just a bit less.

Ring a bell? Cheatcode opportunity!

Software processes being word-intensive translates to:

- If not documented - issue is the momentary nature of "words."
- If poorly documented - issue is the "open to interpretation" nature of words.

Issues due to a "gap" in understanding are very common in the industry. But more interestingly...

- Even when well documented in words - *Deriving information from words is very difficult. This is so due to the lack of audio-visual cues. A great opportunity for cheatcoders.*

  - A one-page late-night email will look to be a lot of hard work.
  - 10 different MoM (meeting notes) will sound smart, even when adding no value, etc.

#lateNightEmails #meetingOPhilia

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/why-tech-fertile/obscure-email-example.jpg)

Here is a true-ish email one of my good colleagues received. The email below perfectly describes the power of words. Words are used here to hide information by providing too much data. #*obscurityByLanguage*

I made changes to hide some identities.

"Thank you Raj, Rani, and the entire team who helped us do this entire exercise onsite, and also the folks involved in debugging at various levels.

We understand that there were some teething issues, of which, the following two were most troubling:

- The numbers were not matching across logins.
- When a person was marked Done, it took a lot of time to mark him/her as such.

We are also aware that there may be issues other than these, but since we have a limited bandwidth, we may not be able to open all chapters in parallel.

However, due attention may be given to them as they are prioritized.

The cause of the second issue was very apparent and was found to be the Done API call taking much longer than expected to respond.

This was rectified by disabling the call through a configuration change and letting the person Done without settlement.

The count issue is particularly interesting.

We have done several rounds of testing where we have logins in parallel and found that the counts do get updated in all the logins correctly. (These tests were of course done on environments other than Prod.)

However, when we did the same experiment today on Prod, we found that the count issue (0..200 to 0…200 …) not only happens when we start the website again (first counting has already happened), but also when the website is already running. (We are already on dashboard or any screen beyond it.)

During this, the application manifests the count problem in the form of 'Red' to 'Yellow' to 'Green' to 'Red' transition of the indicator at the top right of dashboard (which represents the sync statuses) where,

Red = Trying to Connect (because the connection somehow broke)

Yellow = Syncing (trying to transfer data after connection was established)

Now if both these sync states have started to interleave at regular intervals, it is a sign that the connection has irrecoverably broken, and the login may not be able to send/receive any traffic. If we exit the application at this stage and come back, the app will not get past data prep screen.

We believe this very state is when count mismatch will start to begin.

With each login running the exact same query, there is no reason the results can be different for them.

Of course the counts are different on different logins, but each login is correctly reflecting the count it has.

To diagnose this issue and also to reflect these sync states better to the end user, we're thinking (and trying) to make some changes, which will allow a user to better identify when something wrong with sync connection has happened, and the login may no longer be able to reflect the correct count.

Again, this may not be easy, but we will have to figure out why the connection breaks, and may also be our best bet to get the counts right, as the application code neither plays any role in the sync nor in managing the connection for it. (The library internally does.)

Suggestions are welcome."

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/why-tech-fertile/obscurity-by-language.png)

#*obscurityByLanguage* should be clear from the above email. Imagine the cheatcode opportunities that word-intensive business practices provide!

There can be (in fact, there always are):

- Vague descriptions that are intended to mean something else.
- Assumed understandings.
- Missed flows. And many more.

So, we've taken a crunchy cone of a virtual product (software) and added a generous scoop of difficult business practices!

Let's make this more interesting by considering the organizational structures that overlay these practices.

#### Industrial Age Org Structures

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/why-tech-fertile/industrial-age-org.gif)

Let's go ahead and add a scoop of "ancient org structures" to our delicacy!

Cheatcoders always have their fair representation at organizations. At the same time, there are always some people interested in good, honest hard work. Among the well-intended folks, there are hardly any that are willing to "bell the cat."

I took help from game theory to explain the behavior. Here is an excerpt from the book "*The Art of Strategy*":

"The problem of collective action is a variant of the prisoners' dilemma, albeit one with many more than two prisoners. … The problem is, who will risk his life to bell the cat?

… How can an unpopular tyrant control large populations for long periods? Why can a lone bully terrorize a schoolyard? …

But the communication and coordination required for such action is difficult, and the oppressors, knowing the power of the masses, take special steps to keep it difficult. When people must act individually and hope that the momentum will build up, the question arises '*Who is going to be the first?*'. Such a leader will pay a high cost—a broken nose or possibly his life. His reward may be posthumous glory or gratitude. There are people who are moved by considerations of duty or honor, but most find the costs exceed the benefits."

Hardly any team member would like to take a cheatcode issue forward to HR, managers, senior leaders, etc. The same folks would be comfortable sharing the most bitter, caustic, vitriolic feedback on online platforms like Glassdoor. But never to the folks who could really make a difference. I found this strange.

Many might dismiss the online comments simply as "frustrations." But let's hit pause on being judgmental and hit play on being curious.

Using game theory, how can one cheatcoder trouble a big team?

- Cheatcoders know that hierarchy protects them.
- Cheatcoders take steps to ensure they remain protected.
- Moving a popular opinion against them takes lots of coordination.
- Even when coordinated, the cost for the first mover might be very high.

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/why-tech-fertile/game-theory-hierarchy.jpg)

I submit: Large- to mid-sized software orgs are structured taking a leaf from industrial age factories. Factories delegated down multiple layers of hierarchies. This was to mass-produce products. The same goes for software organizations.

These hierarchies tend to have the following characteristics:

1. Ones ahead in the food chain have *complete* control over folks below them.

Managers at software companies control their subordinates' tasks, evaluations, appraisals, growth opportunities, and job security.

2. Lack of access higher up the chain.

When my manager was cheating, I did not reach out to his bosses. Reason: I did not know the right people or how to reach them.

I have known only a couple of leaders that encourage access and support. From many that did encourage access, their past performances did not generate confidence.

Lack of access, clarity, and confidence discouraged me from reporting issues, despite me wanting to.

3. Divided authority.

No one person in the chain of command tends to have "actionable" authority.

Meaning: Even when I gather the courage to bring an inefficiency forward, I am not sure whether something will be done about it.

In such cases, life as an overloaded worker seemed easier than one as a snitching colleague.

To avoid vagueness, let's take a real-life example from a giant Indian IT company:

A team working for a medical equipment organization had multiple cheatcode managers.

Engineers bitched around lunch breaks and coffee machines. But never brought the issues forward. Cheatcoder culture was up to three levels up their chain of hierarchy. Critiquing could land them into trouble.

The hierarchy above three levels was never visible or accessible.

Out of many managers, one was a cheatcode maestro. This was known not only to the engineers but also to the manager group. Yet, no one brought the issue forward.

Everyone was clear about the problem. But they did not have confidence in bringing the issue forward. A pissed-off manager with complete control over your performance is the last thing an engineer wants.

Later, our disaster artist painted some back-to-back masterpieces. Some very important projects went to dump. He was moved to another team.

Note: He was still not fired, which would have been the logical thing to do.

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/why-tech-fertile/cheatcoder-survival.png)

His friends helped him avoid trouble during the bad times. Most engineers will get discouraged from reporting cheatcode issues, seeing such a spectacle.

Cheatcoders survive and thrive at industrially hierarchied software organizations. Any surprises?

Beyond these structural issues, there's another subtle factor that enables cheatcoders to go unnoticed.

#### Invisible Ships

Ever heard of ships not seen or the invisible ships phenomenon?

The story goes like this: When the first Europeans arrived at different coasts, viz. Australia, South America, Cuba, etc., the natives completely ignored them. Only once the sailors landed on the shores did the natives actually "see" the sailors and the ships.

The common theory is that the concept or idea of a ship was so alien to the native worldview that their minds couldn't interpret the visual. Their minds did not see the possibility...

Floating water body == Possible other people == Possible danger.

Essentially, they failed to "see" the ships. Only after the idea of "ship" was absorbed in their minds were the natives able to "see" the ships.

My theory is that something similar happens with cheatcodes. Ignorance of what cheating might "look like" provides growth conditions for cheating.

So, if I were a senior manager and you said to me: "But he just forwarded the email to me!"

And I was like: "And?"

Then I lack the understanding that the person being discussed conducted himself like a *postman*! He did not add value to the task and probably abdicated his responsibilities.

I failed to "see" the ship. Many times, cheatcoders will come ashore, invade the organization, kick out the good people, and take over the land!

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/why-tech-fertile/invisible-ships.png)

A poor Hindi analogy would be "*Kue ka Mendhak*," which literally translates to "the well's frog."

The frog believes the well to be the whole world and lacks exposure to what lies outside the well.

The lack of knowledge about what is a cheatcode helps the cheatcode!

Now, ask yourself: Do you see?

Having explored these reasons, let's wrap up our discussion.

#### In Conclusion

We looked at reasons why the software industry provides space to cheatcoders. The reasons are few in number, but each has a big impact on enhancing the cheatcode landscape.

Some causes were part of the nature of the industry, i.e., the virtual nature of software, while others were man-made (so to speak)—industrial practices, org hierarchies, etc. Yet others were due to the lack of understanding of the issue.

As we can imagine, cheatcodes create problems for both individuals and organizations. We discuss these in the next blog.
