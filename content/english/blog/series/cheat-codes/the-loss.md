#### Recap

Some people thrive at tech companies without doing any meaningful work. They cheat their way through. As part of the blog series, we discuss this phenomenon.

Such people use tricks to game the system. We refer to these tricks as cheat codes.

We've talked about various forms of cheat codes and the reasons they thrive at software organizations. Now, let's explore the losses they cause to both organizations and individuals.

Cheat codes create many troubles. Some are immediate, while others are ripple effects. Ripple effects have bigger impacts on both individuals and organizations. Let's examine them.

#### Overload

In the construction industry, pillars (or columns) are designed to share the load of the structure. When well designed, pillars work together to keep the building standing.

Imagine one pillar *not* taking its share of load. The load would suddenly get unevenly distributed. Excess load would fall on other pillars. Other pillars might *not* have the strength for the added load. If the added load becomes too much, the overloaded pillar might fail, taking the building down with it.

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/the-loss/pillar-overload.png)

In the same way, cheat coders *not* doing their fair share of work add burdens to their peers and subordinates. The subordinates might *not* have the ability to manage the added work. Sometimes teams and projects fail.

But the immediate failure is not the biggest problem. The ripple effect has a bigger impact. Let's understand this further.

##### Pillars - Invisible Overload

The construction industry has an advantage. They can see any faults in the pillar immediately, such as a crack, a bend, water erosion, or physical damage.

In the tech domain, loss is *not* visible to the naked eye. The fact that other pillars take added load is often not known to management or leaders.

This means that many techies end up taking more load than required, without even getting a pat on the back.

Here is my experience.

I was a couple of years into the industry. Working for a postman manager, I was required to:

- Discuss business requirements with the client
- Translate business needs into tech designs
- Write code (of course)
- Test the end-to-end functionality (not just my piece)
- Manage release and deployments

The task was too much for someone only a few years into the industry. But I realize this only now. Personally, I would never let a subordinate take such a burden.

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/the-loss/invisible-overload.jpg)

Nonetheless, two things happened:

1. **All appreciation went to my manager.** He was the one heading the project.
2. And surprisingly, **all blame came my way.** I was the one who got the requirements, made the design, built the code, and had it deployed!

No pat on the back, not even a nod of the head, but a slap on the wrist. This for a pillar that took more than its fair share of load.

It seems like a bad deal to me!

If this wasn't enough, my manager received all the bonuses and salary hikes. 💵💵💵💵 He was also promoted.

This means the inefficient cog in the system was moved to a position of higher authority, allowing an even bigger impact.

Large organizations end up becoming more and more inefficient. If you've known a startup versus a large IT organization, this should make sense.

Invisible load causes:

- Best techies to move out of an organization.
- Second- or third-rate techies to be promoted, leading to sub-standard leaders for larger teams.
- Organization to become more inefficient in the long term.

Building on this, let's look at how such environments shape behaviors.

##### Training Lethargy

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/the-loss/training-lethargy.png)

I mentioned earlier that my manager asked too much from me, and I realize this only now.

One reason is (and this is important):

I was part of a culture where "managers" or "leads" did *not* work hard. This made me believe that such behavior was normal. I believed that leads do not do much, and all the burden falls on juniors like me.

I assumed the natural progression in an IT company is:

- From a developer who works 16-18 hours a day doing all the work...
- To a manager who comes in at 11 a.m....
  - Has coffee
  - Goes for lunch
  - Takes status from developers
  - Sends some emails and goes home

One day, I imagined I would be a manager and enjoy my life to the fullest. This is what I thought, believe it or not!

This leads to my next point.

My organization allowed the cheat code culture to become pervasive. The organization trained its employees into believing that managers and leads are not required to work hard.

The keyword is *trained*.

To prove I wasn't the only one with these delusions, here is an incident.

We worked in an offshore-onshore model. Some colleagues traveled to the client location to help with business understanding and requirements. In this model, we had daily calls with our onsite counterparts.

We were on calls for hours. Sometimes we got tired of holding the phone and put it on speaker. On one such call, a "manager" on the other side said, and I paraphrase:

"I am not taking the trouble of solving this problem. Someone junior needs to solve this problem...

I have been slogging for many years now, and now it's my time to take it easy."

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/the-loss/lethargy-culture.jpg)

The impression was that lethargy is okay for seniors. The organization allowed this impression to be established across ranks by consistently paying and promoting cheat code managers and leads.

This means:

- Middle and higher management were paid to be lethargic.
- Juniors in the team were being "trained" into believing in lethargy.
- Any outsider joining the team was quickly trained into lethargy.
- For individuals, this hurt their careers.
- For the organization, cheat coding created an inefficient team and "trained" the team to stay inefficient.
- Lethargy was a compounding loss to the organization (of competitiveness, new business, financial, and more).

These patterns extend to how teams operate under pressure.

#### Rocking Chair Mode

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/the-loss/rocking-chair-mode.jpg)

I hope the above makes sense. What should also be intuitive is that an overloaded pillar will struggle. A struggling engineer will *not* deliver quality results.

Also, the higher the position of the pillar in the organization, the bigger the overload and impact to results. This means:

- An engineer cheat coder impacts one program.
- A lead cheat coder impacts a few modules.
- An architect cheat coder impacts the whole project.
- A group manager cheat coder affects everything!

I've known teams whose work cycle was always in firefighting mode. In firefighting mode, there is never time to think and implement properly, so:

1. Any new code is always half-baked.
2. Half-baked code produces many issues. Fixes to those issues are once again half-baked.
3. This becomes a vicious cycle with its own life.

**True story...**

An organization ended up building a website in 20,000 hours!

For laymen, latest frontend technologies allow basic applications to be built within one hour. I want to allow a few minutes for the numbers to sink in: 1 hour versus 20,000 hours.

This brings me to the point: the loss to individuals versus the organization.

Individuals within a cheat code team are always in a hurry. They end up developing tunnel vision, solving only the problem at hand and unable to see the bigger picture.

Ever seen a rocking chair or a mouse on a treadmill?

Imagine them for a second. What is the end result?

Nothing!

Engineers working in cheat code environments make a lot of motion but no movement. They mistake being active for being productive.

If a software engineer is unable to think or produce quality technology, their career is doomed, especially in current times. The engineer might survive, but they will not thrive.

When such engineers go back to the marketplace looking for opportunities, they find themselves out of touch. Sometimes they quit the industry.

Here are some real examples:

- Surendra worked in a cheat code team for a long time in firefighting mode. He *talks* about switching jobs but has not been able to for almost five years. Why? During those years, his tech skills became obsolete. He woke up to being obsolete.
- Geeta was laid off during the COVID crisis. Though she has about 15 years of experience, she hasn't been able to get a job in almost a year! Why? She worked in a cheat coder environment that didn't prepare her for the real world.

Engineers become the half-baked code they produced. Karma!

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/the-loss/karma-engineers.jpg)

For the organization, rocking chair mode produces software made of patches. Something always falls apart, and maintenance costs are very high!

High maintenance costs do two things:

1. Reduce client confidence and future project prospects.
2. Drive down profit margins.

Money is lost.

Beyond individual impacts, these issues can spread like an infection.

#### Infection

"Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. We tend to believe our habits are a product of our motivation, talent, and effort. Certainly, these qualities matter. But the surprising thing is, especially over a long time period, your personal characteristics tend to get overpowered by your environment."

-James Clear

Good, smart, motivated individuals do join a cheat code team. But one of two things happens:

1. Categorized as misfits, they quit.
2. The cheat code virus infects them, and they become trained in the trade.

Let's take a few real-life examples:

- Harisha was a fabulous backend engineer, a real gem. After a month, she was put off by a cheat coder's behavior. The next day, she quit.
- Ajoy was a brilliant manager from the few who had both technical and people skills. He could rally his team to achieve the trickiest problems. But cheat coders despised his competence. So, the team simply stopped sending him work. He was not invited to meetings anymore and not consulted on any designs, architecture, or solutions. A few months later, he quit. He joined a world-famous IT giant.
- Vikas joined the team as a manager. In the first few months, he was very enthusiastic to engage in all the work. After the first 3-4 months, he "understood" how the system worked. He moved on to become one of the best postman-type cheat coders in the team.

An infected environment exasperates well-intended folks. They believe that things will remain as is (cheat coding is the way of life). Hence the often-heard phrase: "Nothing can change here."

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/the-loss/infection-examples.jpg)

For the organization, losses are:

1. Inefficiency in the development system.
2. Loss of the most valuable resource in the industry: best minds. Like Bitcoin, good techies have limited availability and cannot be mined limitlessly. Technology is first created in the minds of people. When teams lose the 20% cream talent, they lose the most precious resource: the mind of the creative techie.
3. Cheat code teams and organizations *resist* getting better. Sometimes doctors prescribe antibiotics and recommend completing the course because the virus attempts to mutate and become resistant. In the same way, the longer a cheat code infection survives, the more resistant it becomes to mild doses of medication.
4. Organizations risk their revenue and survival.

For the individual, the longer the bug survives, the more harm it does to the techie's career. A strong dose of medication is needed to get rid of the virus.

It takes a truly strong mind to reform oneself or an organization.

This infected environment often leads to broader toxicity.

#### Toxicity

What does a toxic workplace look like?

- Folks more interested in "proving" to have done the work instead of simply "doing" the work.
- People responding to emails or tickets instead of talking to resolve issues.
- Appreciation to one individual hurting their peers.
- Complaining about an individual instead of their work.
- Coffee time bitching.

Cheat codes hurt meritocracy. This in turn creates a toxic environment. Toxic soil is fertile for weeds but not for fruits.

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/the-loss/toxicity-workplace.jpg)

For individuals, toxicity might result in:

- Bad aftertaste experiences.
- Lack of camaraderie.
- Groupisms (groups within an organization that work against each other).
- Outcast status in teams.

Individual toxicity accumulates at the organizational level.

Working as a team, individuals produce disproportionately more results. Similarly, working against each other, individuals produce barely any results.

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/the-loss/building-strength.jpg)

A building stays as strong as the combined strength of all its parts. When the parts start getting rusty or worn out, the building loses its structural strength.

For organizations, this toxicity results in:

- Many personnel-related escalations and too few work-related ones.
- Many head of department (HOD) intervention requests.
- Hours spent on escalations and explanations.
- Caustic Glassdoor reviews.
- Money down the drain!

Such toxicity stifles innovation and progress.

#### No Sailings to New Seas

**True story...**

A cheat code team had been working for a hospitality industry client for over 15 years. They understood the system inside and out and had a firm grip on the allocated IT funding.

The only problem: working with so many cheat codes, they always had issues on their hands. They were always in "reactive" instead of "proactive" mode.

A new team came in, of one-tenth the size. In the first month, they looked at the infrastructure and moved legacy servers to newer, cheaper, and more agile ones.

First-year savings: $100K.

Second-year projected savings: $150K.

Over the next three years, the client shifted most business from the old team to the new one. Another two years later, the older, more experienced team closed shop with the client.

Someone from the old team would've seen the old inefficient servers, I'm sure. They would've brought some solution forward. But cheat code teams work in firefighting mode and always have urgent issues.

During "urgent" times, suggestions are delayed. When "urgent" is the order of the day, suggestions are never important.

Teams working in "perpetual panic" mode fail to see the most obvious opportunities. This results in:

- Loss of new business opportunities.
- Loss of improvement opportunities.
- Loss to competition.
- Loss of money.

![Image](/images/cheat-codes/the-loss/no-sailings.jpg)

The same happens with individuals in perpetual "rut" work:

- People stop learning. Technologies change every few years. Stopping learning is the kiss of death for one's career.
- People stop experimenting. New technologies offer efficient solutions to existing problems. When people stop trying, solutions are not sought.
- Techies get stuck in their careers. They do not get jobs and complain about lack of opportunities.

In summary, these issues prevent growth and fulfillment.

#### Conclusion

James Clear in his book *Atomic Habits* mentions he became a good athlete but wasn't able to join professional sports. Even so, he fulfilled his potential.

"What a beautiful thing to say," I thought.

We have discussed the specifics of what cheat coding does to a team or individuals. Eventually, what it does is stop people and teams from fulfilling their potential!

I write this article during COVID times (year 2020). I know techies and organizations that could not survive the crisis. I also know some that made radical changes and are surviving (en route to thriving).

Making IT organizations efficient is more important now than before. For this reason, surviving equals avoiding cheat coding.

This brings me to my next point: What steps can be taken to prevent cheat code issues from occurring in the first place? Let's see.
