#### Recap

Some people survive and thrive at tech companies without doing any meaningful work. They cheat their way through. As part of this blog series, we discuss the phenomenon.

Such people use some trade tricks. We'll refer to these as "cheat codes."

To dive deeper into these strategies, let's explore specific examples.

![Cheat Codes Image](/images/cheat-codes/forms-and-flavours/cheat-codes-cover.jpg)

**Cheat Codes**

*A word or phrase that helps a gamer get to the next level without playing the actual game.*

All examples are real-life cases. One of us was a witness to all the mentioned instances.

This sets the stage for examining common cheat codes in action.

#### Late Night Email

*#SymptomEqualsCause*

**Misconception:** Long work hours equal more work.

**Cheat Code Opportunity:** Stay late. Do nothing.

The IT industry has a common misconception that longer work hours equal better work. (Reality is exactly the opposite. Long work hours result in burnout. Burnout, in turn, stretches the work even longer.)

**True Story:**

I had a colleague who did virtually nothing the whole day. Sometime after midnight, he sent an email with some updates to senior leadership.

Late-night emails created the impression that the person worked above and beyond his responsibilities. *#SymptomEqualsCause*

The truth couldn't have been farther.

![Late Night Email Image](/images/cheat-codes/forms-and-flavours/late-night-email-example.png)

The gentleman received many accolades, appreciations, and rewards. This continued until reality caught up, and the project ran into trouble.

At this point, the whole team was asked to carry the weight of the project. The gentleman was working more than his fair share and deserved the team's help (obviously)!

Late-night emails were misunderstood as a measure of good work.

Building on this idea of misleading perceptions, let's look at a related tactic.

#### Odd Work Hours

*#SymptomEqualsCause #DifferentFlavour*

**Misconception:** Regular odd work hours equal important work.

**Cheat Code Opportunity:** Stay late. Do nothing.

This is a nuanced flavor of the cheat code discussed above. Also, this cheat code is a bit difficult to understand.

How about: Someone needs to stay back to finish some work today. Because they stayed back late today, they will come in late tomorrow. Because they come in late tomorrow, they leave late tomorrow. The cycle continues.

![Odd Work Hours Image](/images/cheat-codes/forms-and-flavours/odd-work-hours.jpg)

From a manager's perspective:

Since the person overworked today, he was allowed to slack off tomorrow. Seems reasonable, but is it?

From the employee's perspective:

He is able to work at "low supervision" hours, meaning he found a way to avoid supervision and probably work too, all while giving the impression of overworking!

**True Story:**

A real-life cheat coder, Ankit, figured out this equation. Once he figured out the way to avoid supervision, he ended up doing nothing.

The distances we go in love, war, and laziness 😃😃

In this case, the project ran into trouble, and some colleagues were fired. Ankit got serious and started putting in quality work. The project came back to life.

People are different—some are night owls, while others are morning birds. Also, when one day is tiring, relaxing the next day is reasonable. *Deliberately changing schedules to avoid supervision is cheating.*

During lax supervision, it is easy to claim the moon, all while sipping one's coffee. *#SymptomEqualsCause*

Also, being late tomorrow means that today's work is more important than tomorrow's. This is a false premise. Tomorrow's work keeps accumulating. Pending work is gauged only when delivery timelines near.

Regardless, the "overworker" is hailed as a hero owing to his sacrifices working overtime. Ankit was promoted!

![Promotion Image](/images/cheat-codes/forms-and-flavours/promotion-reward.png)

Shifting from time-based deceptions, consider how meetings can serve as a cover.

#### Meeting-Ophilia

*#Disguise #SymptomEqualsCause*

**Misconception:** Meetings and discussions equal productive work.

**Cheat Code Opportunity:** Attend too many meetings to be able to deliver any "real" work.

![Meeting Image](/images/cheat-codes/forms-and-flavours/meeting-ophilia.png)

**True Story:**

Our friend Sharad asked everyone he met to schedule a meeting with him. Even when not required, he requested to be added just "to be updated." Also, he accepted each invite he received. Of course, his calendar stayed full. He was seen running between meetings.

Whenever asked about his deliverables, he showed his calendar as proof of his busy schedule. The busy schedule was an excuse to not deliver anything.

This cheat code is very commonly found across tech organizations, so I will not elaborate at length. Most, if not all, techies will very easily understand this behavior.

As deadlines neared, a familiar story was repeated. *The team came together and pulled the project through.* This is fancy talk for: Others did Sharad's work by working overtime.

Of course, Sharad was thanked for all the "contribution" he made to the project!

Continuing with variations on busyness, let's examine multitasking as a facade.

#### Travelling in 20 Boats

*#Disguise #SymptomEqualsCause #DifferentFlavor*

![Boats Image](/images/cheat-codes/forms-and-flavours/travelling-boats.jpg)

**Misconception:** Keeping busy equals producing results.

**Cheat Code Opportunity:** Engage in multiple projects, tasks, and workstreams to "show" oneself too busy to produce any deliverable. Then delegate!

**True Story:**

Techies sometimes have "cravings" to show off their tech acumen. Rahul, one such techie, is a director at an organization and has these cravings regularly!

He then plunges himself into the role of a programmer, tech lead, architect, and director, all at the same time.

- Writing code for new systems.
- Stabilizing existing modules.
- Client deployments and handover.
- Solutioning upcoming changes.
- Planning product roadmap for tech growth.

Is he a genius for being able to do so much?

Folks like Rahul, when not able to deliver, choose the next best option. They call their subordinates and ask them to put in long hours. Rahul's team bears the added burden of what he fails to do. Long hours are put in the name of teamwork (a noble cause).

I submit: A 20-boat traveler gets a warm, fuzzy feeling by "looking" busy rather than "being" busy. Thanks to the English language, we have phrases that help—teamwork, pull together, alliance, synergy, no "I" in team, etc.!

Sharad's calendar was proof of his productivity. Here, we have multiple workstreams. Multiple tasks are proof of someone's productivity. Sharad was indeed seen everywhere, but he was not responsible for any value addition anywhere (he was busy!).

The value addition was delegated to his subordinates (fancy talk for asking others to do his work).

The idea of being busy equaling productivity sells well. Unfortunately, management that buys into this idea fails their team.

Exploring another form of apparent productivity, let's discuss excessive communication.

#### Postmanship

*#SymptomEqualsCause #ManagementEqualsDelegation*

![Postman Image](/images/cheat-codes/forms-and-flavours/postman-image.jpg)

**Misconception:** Generating a lot of email equals productive work.

**Cheat Code Opportunity:** Isn't it obvious? :D

Another misconception is that "generating lots of communication" is keeping busy. To the cheat coder, this is another leverage.

**True Story:**

A manager, Arpan, was asked to streamline some work within a certain timeframe. He generated a lot of intelligent-sounding, good-grammar emails. But he did not complete his work within the time period.

Next day: He was fired!

The vice president of the organization told me, and I quote: "He generated a lot of emails and did no work, and I know the difference." :D

Score: VP 1, Manager 0.

![Score Image](/images/cheat-codes/forms-and-flavours/score-vp-manager.png)

I give the honorary title of "postman" to such folks!

**Postmanship:** The performance by a member of the team of simply passing work from one person to another without adding any value whatsoever.

The person is highly paid for being a postman. You might quickly realize this. On one hand, he wastes the company's cash; on the other, he spoils his own career opportunities.

But you will not realize what happens next:

- When something goes wrong: Since the manager simply delegated the task, all mistakes are owned by his subordinates.
- Something goes right: Since he is the quote-unquote "the manager," he gets all the credit.

Paraphrasing from a meeting to explain:

Manager: Mr. Engineer, please share the designs with me.

Engineer: Done.

Manager (without checking, forwards the design to the architect): Mr. Architect, please approve.

Architect: Done.

Manager (to the engineer): FYI & FYA (For Your Information & For Your Action). Let me know once this is done.

Note: If the designs had issues, it's the engineer's fault or architect's fault, but never the manager's.

*The manager was just a postman; therefore safe!*

Postmanship ends up shaking the idea of "meritocracy" in an organization or team. This is also what all cheat codes do.

Beyond communication tricks, emotional manipulation can also play a role.

#### Panic! Leveraged

*#MisusePeopleSkills*

![Panic Image](/images/cheat-codes/forms-and-flavours/panic-leveraged.png)

**Phenomenon:** Humans do silly things during panic or stressful situations.

**Cheat Code Opportunity:** Create panic and leverage.

**True Story:**

I had this conversation some years back:

Co-worker: Dude! Engine is not running!

Me: Hmm, what happened?

Co-worker: I have escalated to the director, I have escalated to the VP!

We will miss our timelines!

I will call the delivery manager.

Me: So, what happened?

Co-worker: Deep!

You have to leave everything else and do this, else (the world will end or something along those lines).

###### Translation:

I am unable to do my work. Please help.

The person asking for help knows that "panic" is a leverage. He will use the leverage to help him get the work done.

I clearly knew that panic was the tool to ask for help instead of a simple "please help figure this out." I, as a lead in the organization, knew and understood this. But many other leads, middle, and higher management aren't always able to.

The first thing a manager sees during a panic situation is the fleeting bonus checks, as if "Red Bull gave it wings" 💸💸💸. This vision of the flying-away check allows cheat coders to take advantage of folks.

So, panic, stress, and confusion are on the menu tonight!

![Menu Image](/images/cheat-codes/forms-and-flavours/panic-menu.jpg)

I had a peer who did nothing during the actual timeline of the project. He worked on creating false impressions of work using tricks we already discussed.

Once the project was at risk, he asked for help and rallied the team in the name of "teamwork." He consistently convinced senior management to get the "team's" participation. This was very strange to me.

Note that *he leveraged fear* to his benefit. Higher management was afraid of not being able to deliver to the client. He was able to get away without any real contribution for a long time. After some five years, management really "saw" what was going on. He was moved out of the team.

Why does this phenomenon exist?

My opinion is: During panic, stress, confusion, or any such situation, the first thing people lose is their head (mind)!

Not having a calm, composed self, most are unable to think straight and put two and two together.

Furthermore, the smart cheaters present themselves as the calm solution, which is something management needs during trouble.

Language can also be a tool for obfuscation, as we'll see next.

#### Obscurity by Language

*#Deceive #WordsOverWork*

![Language Image](/images/cheat-codes/forms-and-flavours/language-obscurity.jpg)

**Misconception:** Technology is complex.

**Cheat Code Opportunity:** Write long or complex emails to hide the real details.

Language is a powerful tool. It is more powerful than most understand it to be. Combine that with expertise in a subject. Results are words like:

- Iatrogenesis (when a doctor mistakenly hurts or kills patients).
- Regular mutual fund (pay 1% of your hard-earned money, mostly for no good reason).

What if I told you:

"Hey, that was iatrogenic" vs. "Hey, that was the doctor's fault."

Feel the difference? Notice: The intrinsic purpose of these words is to hide the real meaning.

Obscure language can be used to hide one's mistakes, take credit away, blame, and more. It is more common than you might think.

Let us use the same concept for the IT industry. What if I purposely write the following lines to explain an issue:

**True(ish) Mail:**

The online team sent a request to the middleware team; it was subsequently load balanced and analyzed. We had a meeting with DevOps to understand whether the servers were set up correctly. Next step was to research the request on the server, and there we found some logs that are still being analyzed. The final outcome might be related to application server engagement with the DB.

What do you think the issue was?

How about: *DB locks.*

![DB Locks Image](/images/cheat-codes/forms-and-flavours/db-locks.png)

**Or:**

We have been working on the issue with x-commit teams since the day and have found that UI performance did not have any issues. Instead, the issue could be with any of the possible backend solutions. Seems to us that UI is not working due to sync issues. We have been working in a war room to investigate these solutions with tools like JMeter, Debug, Jconsole, and heap monitoring tools. We will send out hourly updates, and you can give me a call in case anything urgent is needed.

Were you able to find the actual cause? Let's see.

Above translates to: *Sync not working.*

How about taking credit away and blaming?

- (To junior) You were responsible for getting this done.

*Read: Blaming away when something goes wrong.*

- (To senior) We have been working on the issue for a very long time and have not yet found any solution.

*Read: Collective blame when something goes wrong.*

- I have found a solution to the problem. (Notice the missing "we.")

*Read: Taking individual credit when something goes well.*

Obscurity by language is easy and yet very effective. It is one of the favorite tools for cheat code users—from rookies to pros. No wonder.

Having explored this flavor, let's move on to another tactic involving time management.

#### Analysis Blackhole

*#Hide*

**Misconception:** New technologies take time.

**Cheat Code Opportunity:** Take my sweet time for something very quick.

Today's technologies are designed to be used with ease. Any technology that has a high learning trajectory loses to its competitors.

The word "long" is subjective. Sometimes the domain, integrations, or use cases are complex. But techies too can hide their real effort, be plain old lazy, and misuse their timelines.

![Blackhole Image](/images/cheat-codes/forms-and-flavours/analysis-blackhole.jpg)

Analysis blackhole is a common phenomenon. This can be done by overestimation or underreporting.

- Research into a new technology.
- Development of a prototype or a POC (proof of concept) taking very long.

Overestimation is done knowing that the work instead might be done in a tenth of the estimated time. Underreporting is done by showcasing less work than is actually achieved—an easy task.

Finally, let's consider how personal excuses can be exploited.

#### Dereliction

*#Desertion #MisusePeopleSkills*

**Phenomenon:** Humans are emotional beings.

**Cheat Code Opportunity:** Misuse human emotions to one's advantage.

I observed a strange phenomenon. Some of my friends tended to have "personal" issues only around the time something difficult came up.

The issues ranged from poor internet connection, traveling to native town, family emergency, or some sudden illness. Don't get me wrong; some folks might need a breather, but:

Once: Possibly a situation.

Twice: Maybe a misfortune.

Thrice: Makes the believers doubt!

![Dereliction Image](/images/cheat-codes/forms-and-flavours/dereliction-example.jpg)

**True Story:**

Releases and deployments were really tricky, time-taking, and tiring for one of our projects. Releases used to take their toll on us developers.

One of our cheat code colleagues was drop-dead gorgeous! She was also someone everyone knew to be an idiot (of course, a beautiful idiot).

She had consistent troubles during times of releases. This was strange! Urgent personal work, family member sick, she is sick—the situations became so common that we started guessing the upcoming trouble for the next releases.

Jokes aside, I wish her well, and I hope she gets the sense to stop the silliness. Do you know someone similar?

#### Conclusion

With this, we come to the end of cheat codes.

We talked about cheat codes in some of their flavors and forms. This was not a comprehensive list—only ones I gathered from my experiences. As much as they work, my recommendation will be to not use them.

Why?

Karma—it catches up with you!

If I use cheat codes, sooner or later, I will fall and fall badly. In the end, it might not be worth it!

![Karma Image](/images/cheat-codes/forms-and-flavours/karma-catches-up.jpg)

While laziness can happen in any industry, why are tech industry cheat codes so prevalent? The tech industry seems to provide fertile grounds for cheat coders to not only survive but also thrive. But why?

That is the topic we'll discuss in the next blog.

Until then, long live honesty!
