#### Recap

Some people thrive at tech companies without doing any meaningful work. They cheat their way through. As part of the blog series, we discuss this phenomenon.

Such people use tricks to game the system. We refer to these tricks as cheatcodes.

We've discussed:

- Forms of cheatcodes
- Reasons they thrive at software organizations
- Losses cheatcodes create
- Tips on avoiding them

Now we discuss how to cure cheatcode culture.

Once again, the list below is more of a recommendation set than a solution template. Feel free to read, research, investigate, and take common-sense steps, or reach out to me to discuss more.

User discretion is advised before using a method.

To begin addressing this issue, let's explore practical strategies.

#### Avoid

![](/images/cheat-codes/medicate-heal/avoid.jpg)

First and foremost, avoid creating any more cheatcodes. Simple enough!

To do that, use all ideas discussed in the previous blog. With prevention in mind, the next step is to examine reality objectively.

#### Look at Things as Is

People look at things through the glasses of their upbringing, family, culture, education, personal biases, and more. For example, Indians do not mind being late, sometimes by hours. Japanese, on the other hand, take great offense at being even a minute late. Same reality, different perceptions!

People and organizations tend to deny reality for many reasons, such as:

- Desire to believe that one could not have made *such a mistake*. There must be another reason.
- Desire to feel we've accomplished more than we actually have.

This is a common challenge.

For cheatcode-infested organizations, the first step I recommend is to have the strength and courage to look at things *as is*. This might sound simple, but human emotions drive simple things to complexity.

Organizations imagine reasons for poor performances, such as:

- Maybe the programmers aren't smart enough.
- It's the client, unable to articulate and work with us.
- Competition rendered us helpless, and more.

And they do not accept the real reasons, like:

- The manager does not contribute enough to his job and therefore needs to go. By the way, he is also a good friend.
- My favorite lead is actually a farcical idiot. He is more into talking than into working.
- The programmer I have been going gaga about is inflexible. The organization needs to support him more than he does the organization.

Essentially, look at issues as they are and not as we'd like them to be. Too often, we (myself included) do not challenge things we observe on a daily basis. We "train" ourselves into believing that it is the way things are supposed to be.

![](/images/cheat-codes/medicate-heal/reality-perception.jpg)

I've mentioned this earlier: I believed that managers relax and developers toil. This is an example of how reality is incorrectly perceived.

Sometimes outsiders can help. A fresh perspective shines light on things we take for granted.

And once we look at things as they are, we realize:

- The manager is confident, communicative, and good for a client-facing role. But he has been unable to deliver quality work. Confidence is needed, but it is not a replacement for deliverables.
- Friendships are great, but they are not a replacement for work or deliverables.
- Employment duration is not a good measure of a person's value; his contribution is.
- Designation is a representation of the current role. It is not a pass to the "take it easy" lounge.
- Lack of tech skills is just that—lack of tech skills. It is not a measure of a person, etc.

Looking at things as they are (even with someone else's help) will help separate the signal from the noise. This is the first step in getting rid of cheatcodes.

Building on this foundation of clear perception, the next principle helps prioritize efforts effectively.

#### 80/20 Principle

The 80/20 principle (also called Pareto's principle) states that most results are caused by very few causes. These causes are also called *the vital few*. For example:

- Most sales will be generated by few customers.
- Most time on the smartphone will be spent on a few apps.
- Most wealth will be generated by few organizations or individuals.
- Most software bugs will be caused by few modules or lines of code.

![](/images/cheat-codes/medicate-heal/80-20-principle.png)

Extrapolating the principle for our use, we will find that:

- Most cheatcoding is done by few individuals.
- Most time is spent resolving few cheatcode issues.
- Few systems, practices, or people hide most cheatcodes.
- Few individuals handle most cheatcode overload.

Therefore, most cheatcoding can be resolved by fixing few people, processes, or systems. Get to *the vital few* first. So:

- Fix or get rid of the few cheatcoders.
- Bridge the few gaps that lose most effort.
- Add, remove, or simplify the few business practices.
- Listen to the overburdened few first.

Resolving *the vital few* will give the most benefit. The few will give 80% results immediately. Results will cascade across the organization. Remaining 20% will take a much longer time.

With priorities set, it's important to consider the outcomes of decisions over time.

#### Resulting

Poker has a concept called "resulting." In simple words, it means that sometimes:

- Good bets lose money, and
- Bad bets make money.

Resolving cheatcoding will cause short-term pain. The person responsible for fixing the team needs to understand the concept of *resulting*.

![](/images/cheat-codes/medicate-heal/resulting.jpg)

Extrapolating *resulting* into the real world, sometimes:

- I will drink and drive, and nothing bad will happen to me. No cop will catch me; I'll not have an accident. In fact, the experience will be loads of fun. I might boast about it and might see the disciplined folks as suckers.
- Other times, I will not be drunk and might have an accident.

But if I drive drunk all the time, then I am almost certain to end up in an accident, jail, or worse.

![](/images/cheat-codes/medicate-heal/short-term-long-term.png)

In the short term, *the end result is not always related to the quality of the decision itself*.

In our context:

- Firing a cheatcoder might cause some immediate issues. The attrition might cause some delays. The person might wean away some of the team's good programmers. He might create social media unrest, etc. But in the long term, the cheatcode-free team will perform better.
- Techies can be pressured into working overtime. They can be forced to deliver more than they can. Software delivered by the end of the week, month, or day. But (and this is a big but) the work itself will be of poor quality. Repairs will end up consuming more time than what might've been needed to do the work well in the first place.

Stopping such practices will cause short-term delays and will result in long-term effectiveness.

Poor decisions sometimes result in good outcomes. They end up becoming the norm. For example:

- Sometimes meetings help resolve issues. Meetings become a 24/7 activity.
- Overloading an expert helps the project move. Sending him all work becomes the norm.
- Sometimes a team stretches to complete work. Overworking the team becomes the norm.

Decisions need to be evaluated objectively. The person responsible for fixing an organization needs to understand the concept of *resulting*. He cannot drive only based on the results.

Remember: Poor bets will inherently encourage cheatcoding, even if they benefit in the short term. Good bets will automatically discourage cheatcoding, even if they lose in the short term.

Beyond strategic principles, foundational qualities are essential for team members.

#### Common Sense

##### Integrity, Energy, and Intellect

I read this phrase in a Naval Ravikant book. It has stuck with me since. Techies need to have these skills: integrity, energy, and intellect.

More importantly, *in the same order*.

Let's be honest: It's impossible for any of us to look at every single corner all the time. Rather, it is possible, but too inefficient for any organization to function profitably.

That being the case, the highest priority skill is integrity. Dishonest but smart folks will always find creative ways to cheat the system.

Next, high-integrity but lazy people will find ways (honest ways) to not work. They need to be replaced by high-energy individuals.

Finally comes intellect. Like a good tool, intellect is great, but only when used at the right place and controlled by a good handler.

Intellect without integrity and energy is of no value to an organization.

As we wrap up these strategies, let's reflect on the broader implications.

#### Conclusion

"*Just as for the fish moving inside the water, it cannot be known as to when they are drinking water.*"

It cannot be fully known when techies use, and when they abuse, the freedom given to them. Discomforting but true!

This blog series was to help discuss a common issue. This issue is hardly discussed, rarely understood, and seldom solved at software organizations.

My intent was to help everyone in the industry understand the issue and possibly help resolve it too.

In the beginning of the series, I mentioned that I would consider my information successful when:

- Any layman from the IT industry understands the material easily. Whether they agree with the ideas is for another blog series.
- Importantly, my reasons are able to carry the weight of my opinions. Also, that I am able to share information objectively and without bias.

Coming to the end, I hope I have measured up to my own standards.
