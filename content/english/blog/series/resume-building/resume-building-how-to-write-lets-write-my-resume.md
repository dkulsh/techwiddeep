# Resume Building: Refining My Professional Story (Practical Example)

In this series, I'm guiding fresh college grads, new joiners, and professionals across industries to craft resumes that resonate in the real world. This is part 4 of our resume-building journey, focusing on *how to write*. Having explored editing principles in the previous post, I'll refine my resume, guiding readers through the process to apply these ideas effectively. Let's refine our resume!

## Disclaimer

> **Principle**: Transparency builds trust—share what you know and admit what you don't.

I'm not a resume-building expert, nor have I consulted extensively with HR or recruiters.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/how-to-write-lets-write/disclaimer-note.png" alt="Disclaimer note" caption="This guide reflects real-world experience, not theoretical expertise." >}}

My insights come from conducting and attending multiple interviews, learning from peers, juniors, mentors, and brainstorming with friends. This guide reflects real-world experience, not theoretical expertise.

## Profile Summary

> **Idea**: A concise, quantified summary grabs attention and sets the stage.

Let's apply our editing principles to refine my resume, starting with the summary.

### First Draft
*Software engineer with nearly a decade of experience as a developer, lead, and architect. Proficient in open-system technologies like Java, Android, database servers, and Unix scripting. Managed multiple projects as a lead and a few as an architect, leading teams of 3–10 to deliver projects worth up to $500K. Consistently appraised among the organization's top performers.*

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/how-to-write-lets-write/profile-summary-observations.jpg" alt="Profile summary observations" caption="The first draft is brief and quantifies some aspects, but we want it to be awesome (closer to 9/10)." >}}

**Observations**:
- It's brief and quantifies some aspects (team size, project budget).
- It covers technical skills (Java, Android) and management experience ($500K projects).
- Overall, it's fair (6/10), but we want it to be *awesome* (closer to 9/10).

**Improvements Needed**:
- Add more business-relevant details to appeal to employers.
- Include additional numbers to clarify scope, depth, and impact.
- Highlight performance metrics to sell my value.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/how-to-write-lets-write/improvements-needed.jpg" alt="Improvements needed" caption="We need to add more business-relevant details and performance metrics." >}}

### Final Draft
*Software engineer lead with several years' experience implementing large back-end systems in Java and its family of technologies, including over a dozen projects as a lead/architect. Led re-architecture of a critical system processing up to 10 million records/day, improving performance by 100%, saving ~$10K daily. Redesigned the client's second-largest business process, boosting performance by 500%, enabling a major revamp and securing $500K in new business. Awarded the Performers' Trophy by the client VP, given to the top 2%, for impactful technology changes.*

**Notes**:
- Quantified impact: 10M records/day, 100% performance improvement, $10K daily savings, 500% process improvement, $500K business.
- Highlighted specific achievements (e.g., client VP award for top 2%).
- Kept it slightly longer for detail but will refine further as needed.

> **Principle**: Embrace imperfection to move forward, but stay driven to improve.

## Education

> **Principle**: Include education only if it adds value to your profile.

My resume skips the education section because, at my experience level, it adds little value to recruiters.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/how-to-write-lets-write/education-guidelines.png" alt="Education guidelines" caption="If you choose to include education, a simple table works well." >}}

If you choose to include it, a simple table works:

| College       | Intermediate   | High School |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| 2003–2007     | 2000–2002      | 2000        |
| 70%           | 75%            | 82%         |

**Guidelines**:
- Include college/university details only if prestigious (e.g., IIT, IIM).
- Highlight honors or special achievements if applicable.
- Ensure the section promotes your value to the recruiter.

## Skills

> **Idea**: Organize and highlight skills to showcase expertise tailored to the role.

Skills can be categorized in various ways.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/how-to-write-lets-write/skills-categorization.png" alt="Skills categorization" caption="There are multiple ways to organize your skills effectively." >}}

### Technology Basis (My Choice)
- **Programming Languages**: Java, HTML, Python  
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: Spring, Struts, EJB  
- **Tools**: Jenkins, Git, Maven  
- **Business Domains**: Banking, **Hospitality**, Automobile  
- **Databases**: DB2, Oracle, Mongo  

### Timeline Basis
- **2008**: Eclipse, Java, Unix, Scripting, Oracle  
- **2010**: Java (EJBs), DB2, Banking & Insurance, Scripting  
- **2012**: Java (Spring), Performance Engineering, Reporting (SSRS, Power BI)  
- **2015**: MongoDB, Android, System Redesign, CI/CD, TDD  

### Proficiency Basis
- **Most Proficient**: Java, Spring, Oracle  
- **Next-Level Skills**: Spring, Hibernate  
- **Emerging Skills**: MongoDB, Android  

**Highlighting Strategy**:
- Emphasize skills based on competence and job requirements (e.g., bold, underline).
- Customize for the role: Highlight Android skills for Android positions, Java for backend roles.

I maintain two resume versions (Java and Android) to tailor to specific roles. You can do the same!

## Work Details

> **Principle**: Quantify and prioritize impactful contributions to stand out.

Let's refine my project drafts to make them concise, quantified, and impressive.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/how-to-write-lets-write/work-details-refinement.png" alt="Work details refinement" caption="We'll refine project drafts to make them concise, quantified, and impressive." >}}

### Project 1: Embark - First Draft
**Name**: Embark  
**Tech Stack**: Android, Couchbase, Tools and Libraries (LeakCanary, Barcode, OCR Readers)  
**Description**:  
- Integrated magnetic swipe hardware into the application.  
- Resolved memory leaks from the Android application, addressing listeners, singleton classes, callback registrations.  
- Implemented an Android-based project with:  
  - Code refactoring to fix design issues and improve performance.  
  - UI refactoring to improve GPU rendering and UI performance.  

**Role**:  
- Individual contributor/programmer.  
- Tech lead for a 2–3 member team.

**Observations**:  
- Lacks quantification.  
- Unclear value to the organization/marketplace.  
- Items not ordered by impact.
