# Resume Building: Polishing My Visual Story (Practical Example)

In this series, I'm guiding fresh college grads, new joiners, and professionals across industries to craft resumes that shine in the real world. This is part 5 of our resume-building journey, focusing on *beautifying* my resume. Let's polish my resume's presentation to make it stand out and leave a lasting impression!

## Disclaimer

> **Principle**: Transparency builds trust—share what you know and admit what you don't.

I'm not a resume-building expert, nor have I consulted extensively with HR or recruiters.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/beautify-lets-write/disclaimer-note.png" alt="Disclaimer note" caption="This guide reflects real-world experience, not theoretical expertise." >}}

My insights come from conducting and attending multiple interviews, learning from peers, juniors, mentors, and brainstorming with friends. This guide reflects real-world experience, not theoretical expertise.

## Visual Enhancements

> **Idea**: Strategic visuals make your resume memorable and recruiter-friendly.

With our content refined, let's focus on making it visually appealing. Here's how I added visual elements to my resume.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/beautify-lets-write/visual-enhancements.png" alt="Visual enhancements approach" caption="Let's explore specific visual enhancements I've used in my resume." >}}

### Experience
I started with a timeline and image for my work experience:

This format worked initially, but I later refined both content and design:

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/beautify-lets-write/experience-format.png" alt="Experience format evolution" caption="Both formats have merit, but adding a new role made the second, simpler format more effective." >}}

Both formats have merit, but adding a new role made the second, simpler format more effective. *It's okay to keep improving*—iteration is part of the process.

### Work Locations
To highlight my onsite experience, I added a map of work locations (Minneapolis, US; Bangalore, India; Delhi, India):

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/beautify-lets-write/work-locations.png" alt="Work locations map" caption="This depiction worked a few times but lost impact over time, so I removed it after a few months." >}}

This depiction worked a few times but lost impact over time, so I removed it after a few months. Flexibility is key—test and adapt.

### Skills
I invested effort in a visual, timeline-based depiction of my skills:

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/beautify-lets-write/skills-timeline.png" alt="Skills timeline" caption="Using text-filled images helped non-technical recruiters." >}}

Using text-filled images helped non-technical recruiters. This worked for a while, but I later simplified it:

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/beautify-lets-write/skills-simplified.png" alt="Skills simplified" caption="The simpler version feels cleaner and more effective." >}}

The simpler version feels cleaner and more effective. Continuous improvement isn't about "fixing mistakes" but evolving what works.

### Projects
Here's the final version of my project section after multiple edits:

| Project | Client Onboarding – Performance and Code Refactoring |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Tech Stack** | Android, Couchbase, LeakCanary, Everit JSON Schema Validation |
| **Description** | **Task**: Refactor code and improve app performance<br>- **Resolved 18 MB memory leak** from the app.<br>- **Reduced method call duplications, chaining, and eager loading**, improving app performance by **10%**.<br>- **Un-nested UI view hierarchy and reduced overdraws**, achieving a **70% performance improvement** and earning **CEO appreciation**.<br>- **Optimized object creations** (e.g., "new Gson()"), reducing method time from **44 ms to 3 ms**.<br>- **Rewrote AsyncTasks** to use executeOnExecutor for better hardware performance.<br>- Reconfigured data structures to reduce memory and CPU consumption.<br>- Integrated magnetic swipe hardware into the application. |
| **Role** | - Individual contributor/programmer. |

**Notes**:
- The table adds structure, making it easier to read.
- Numbers and key ideas are **underlined** for emphasis.
- The project's main goal is summarized in one line with **highlighted text**.

## Wrapping Up

> **Principle**: A polished resume blends content and visuals to tell a compelling story.

This concludes our resume-building series. I hope it's clear that crafting a resume is *hard but not complicated*. As I shared initially, I struggled to learn the "rights" and "wrongs" of resume writing:

1. I wanted to focus on tech skills but spent disproportionate time on resume books, blogs, templates, and images.
2. Even after learning best practices (brevity, quantification), I lacked the "mental muscle" to apply them. As a junior engineer, I wasn't trained to track project dollars or impact, and I had no mentor.

This series distills books, blogs, experience, failures, and successes into a guide that's **easy for a layman to understand**.

### Success Looks Like:
You, as a non-expert, understanding resume-building essentials, creating a solid resume, and feeling confident in days.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/beautify-lets-write/success-looks-like.png" alt="Success looks like" caption="The next two blogs will showcase a poorly made version and a well-edited version of my resume." >}}

The next two blogs will showcase:
1. A poorly made version of my resume.
2. A well-edited version of my resume.

These will highlight the value of our approach. Let's move on!
