# Resume Building: Crafting My Professional Story (Practical Example)

In this series, I'm guiding fresh college grads, early-career professionals, and seasoned tech folks to create resumes that work. Amid 2020's job market challenges, this is my small contribution to help you stand out. Forget outdated advice like "get good grades, work hard, and you're set"—the real world demands more.

To make this practical, I'm building my own resume step-by-step, following the principles shared in my previous blog. This post covers the *what* of my resume content. The next will dive into the *how* of resume writing. Let's get writing!

---

## Summary

> **Principle**: A concise summary sets the stage for your professional story.

Let's start by building my resume step-by-step to bring these ideas to life. Here are the high-level pointers for my resume:

- Nearly 10 years of experience.
- Technology focus: Backend and middle-tier (minimal front-end work).
- Technologies: Java (Spring, EJB, Struts), Data Structures, Multithreading, Oracle, DB2, Unix.
- Organizations: Primarily service industry, some product industry.
- Domain: Banking and capital markets.
- Work Type: Developer, designer, bug fixing, performance improvement.
- Achievements: Awards, recognitions, and multiple successful projects.

With these in mind, I'll craft my profile summary.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/what-to-write-lets-write/summary-first-draft.jpg" alt="Summary first draft example" caption="The summary feels adequate but could use more polish. We'll refine it in the upcoming How to Write blog." >}}

### Summary: First Draft
*Software engineer with nearly a decade of experience as a developer, lead, and architect. Proficient in open-system technologies like Java, Android, database servers, and Unix scripting. Managed multiple projects as a lead and a few as an architect, leading teams of 3–10 to deliver projects worth ~$500K. Consistently appraised among the organization's top performers.*

The summary feels adequate but could use more polish. We'll refine it in the upcoming *How to Write* blog.

> **Idea**: Embrace imperfection to move forward, but stay driven to improve.

## Education

> **Principle**: Focus on relevance—education matters less with experience.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/what-to-write-lets-write/education-section.jpg" alt="Education section approach" caption="Here's how I'd approach my education section with a focus on relevance." >}}

Here's how I'd approach my education section:

| College       | Intermediate   | High School |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| 2003–2007     | 2000–2002      | 2000        |
| 70%           | 75%            | 82%         |

Key points:

- I omitted college/school names and locations because they're unimportant for my profile. If yours are relevant (e.g., a Tier 1 institution), include them.
- With nearly 10 years of experience, my college scores hold little weight for employers.
- Education is often less critical than you might think.

Given my experience, I'd likely **skip this section**. If you're over 5 years into your career, consider its relevance for your resume.

---

## Skills

> **Idea**: Highlight skills clearly to showcase your expertise.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/what-to-write-lets-write/skills-timeline.jpg" alt="Skills timeline approach" caption="This section is critical. Here's my skillset with a timeline approach." >}}

This section is critical. Here's my skillset with a timeline:

- **2008**: Eclipse, Java, Unix, Scripting, Oracle
- **2010**: Java (EJBs), DB2, Banking & Insurance, Scripting
- **2012**: Java (Spring), Performance Engineering, Reporting (SSRS, Power BI)
- **2015**: MongoDB, Android, System Redesign, CI/CD, TDD

Should you always use a timeline? Not necessarily—other formats work too, as we'll explore in the *How to Write* blog.

For freshers, a smaller tech stack is fine. Focus on relevant tools and technologies. Avoid "doctoring" skills to seem more experienced—it backfires. Instead:

- **Learn the Lingo**: Note unfamiliar terms from interviews, tests, or books. Ask their meaning, understand them, and add them to your resume.
- **Depth Over Breadth**: In-depth knowledge of a few technologies trumps a shallow grasp of many.

A strong tech vocabulary with a modest but honest skillset is more valuable than exaggerated claims.

## Work Details

> **Principle**: Quantify your contributions to make your impact clear.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/what-to-write-lets-write/work-details-focus.jpg" alt="Work details focus areas" caption="Recruiters focus on two things in your work history: Technology Set and Width or Depth of Your Work." >}}

Recruiters focus on two things in your work history:

- **Technology Set**
- **Width or Depth of Your Work**

Here's how I'd detail my projects:

### Project 1: Embark
**Tech Stack**: Android, Couchbase, Tools/Libraries (LeakCanary, Barcode, OCR Readers)  
**Description**:  
- Integrated magnetic swipe hardware into the application.  
- Resolved memory leaks by addressing listeners, singleton classes, and callback registrations.  
- Refactored code to fix design issues and boost performance.  
- Improved UI rendering for better GPU performance.  

**Role**:  
- Individual contributor/programmer.  
- Tech lead for a 2–3 member team.

### Project 2: Facial Recognition
**Tech Stack**: Amazon DeepLens, Python (tools/libraries), Spring, Android, Couchbase  
**Description**:  
Enabled passenger onboarding on a cruise via live video camera feed.  
- Researched face recognition technologies (DeepLens, Google APIs, Python's face_recognition library).  
- Built a successful POC using DeepLens.  
- Integrated a flow: Camera Feed → Python Recognition → Spring App → CouchDB → Android Device.  

This POC positioned the organization for multimillion-dollar projects.  

**Role**:  
- Individual contributor/programmer.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/what-to-write-lets-write/project-examples.jpg" alt="Project examples showcase" caption="These projects demonstrate both technical depth and business impact." >}}

### Project 3: New Web App
**Tech Stack**: Spring MVC, Java, MySQL, Web Technologies, SSRS, Tomcat, SMTP  
**Description**:  
- Built an integrated application to streamline a scattered business induction process.  
- Implemented SSRS reporting, reducing build time by 90% (from 90 hours to 8 hours).  
- Used Tomcat to cut costs compared to other web servers.  
- Conducted code, data structure, and algorithm reviews.  
- Selected stack: Spring JPA, Spring Validations, SMTP (mailing), HTML, JavaScript.  
- Ensured TDD with Spring MVC integration.  
- Established CI/CD pipeline: Git → Maven → SonarQube → Cobertura → JUnit → Artifactory → Jenkins.  

**Role**:  
- Tech lead for a 3-developer team.

### Project 4: App Migration
**Tech Stack**: Java, WebSphere, EJB, Tomcat, Spring (MVC, JMS)  
**Description**:  
- Migrated an application from WebSphere to Tomcat, saving significant costs in the first year and beyond.  
- Researched open-system alternatives for WebSphere's libraries (e.g., Camel vs. Spring JMS, Spring JPA vs. Hibernate).  
- Programmed and integrated the app with unit and integration tests for a robust product.  

**Role**:  
- Individual contributor/programmer.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/what-to-write-lets-write/project-notes.png" alt="Project notes and guidelines" caption="Key considerations for project selection and presentation." >}}

**Notes**:  
- I could list more projects, but recruiters often stop reading after a few. I'll focus on polishing these.  
- Excluded hobbies (irrelevant to the role).  
- Omitted college projects (not a fresher). Freshers should include solid college projects with details.  
- Ensured skills and project details are authentic, using relevant tech vocabulary.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/what-to-write-lets-write/wrapping-up.jpg" alt="Wrapping up the first draft" caption="This is the first draft of my resume's key sections. It's far from perfect—and that's okay." >}}

## Wrapping Up

This is the first draft of my resume's key sections. It's far from perfect—and that's okay. I skipped sections like previous organizations, which could either list past organizations chronologically or integrate them with project details, including the organization name.

With the bare bones in place, the next blog will focus on *how* to polish this content—trimming the unnecessary, enhancing the essential, and making it shine.

Till then, happy learning! Share your feedback, like, comment, or reach out with your thoughts.
