# Resume Building: Crafting Your Professional Story

In this series, I aim to guide fresh college grads, early-career professionals, and seasoned tech industry folks in creating resumes that stand out. With job losses and uncertainty in 2020, this is my small contribution to help you navigate the job market. Forget the outdated advice of "get good grades, work hard, and you're set." The real world plays by different rules.

I'll build my own resume step-by-step, sharing practical insights to help you craft yours with confidence. This blog series is divided into three parts:

- **The "What" of Resume Making**: Covered here, focusing on the core content.
- **The "How" of Resume Writing**: Coming next, diving into structure and execution.
- **The "Beautification" of the Resume**: The final part, polishing for impact.

Let's get started!

## Why Bother?

> **Idea**: A resume is your ticket to an interview—make it count.

In 2020, do we really need another resume-building blog? Isn't all the information already online?

When I sought a career change years ago, I found the answer was *no*. The information was available but scattered and unhelpful:

- Template websites lacked guidance on *content*.
- Content advice was too complex for beginners and didn't align with templates.
- High-quality content wasn't ranking high on Google, making it hard to find.
- Even after reading, translating that knowledge into a compelling resume was tough.

Frustrated, I did what many software engineers do: I copied from someone with a well-paying job.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/copying-resume-example.jpg" alt="Example of copying someone else's resume" caption="Spoiler: It didn't work. It wasted my time." >}}

As the Hindi saying goes, *"Doodh ka jala, chaach bhi phoonk phoonk ke pita hai"* (once bitten, twice shy). Learning the right way to build a resume was a slog. My challenges were:

1. **Time Split**: I wanted to focus on honing my tech skills, but I was stuck reading resume books, blogs, trying templates, and designing images. It took disproportionate effort to learn the "right" way.
2. **Mental Muscle**: Even after learning best practices like brevity and quantification, I struggled to apply them. As a junior engineer, I wasn't trained to think about project scale or dollar impact, and I had no mentor to guide me.

This blog distills books, blogs, personal experience, failures, and successes into a guide that's **easy for a layman to understand**. All credit for the good ideas goes to others; any mistakes are mine.

### Success Looks Like:
A non-expert understanding resume-building essentials, creating a solid resume, and feeling confident in days.

## Disclaimer

> **Principle**: Transparency builds trust—share what you know and admit what you don't.

I'm no resume-building expert, nor have I consulted HR professionals extensively. My insights come from:

- Conducting and attending multiple interviews.
- Learning from peers, juniors, mentors, and brainstorming sessions.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/disclaimer-note.png" alt="Disclaimer note" caption="This guide reflects real-world experience, not theoretical expertise." >}}

This guide reflects real-world experience, not theoretical expertise. Let's move forward with that clarity.

## The Basics

> **Idea**: A resume is your professional face—make it clean, crisp, and compelling.

Let's dive into the essentials of resume building to set a strong foundation. Here are the key questions:

### What Is a Resume?
A resume is the face of your professional experience. It should be clean, crisp, and attractive.

### Why a Resume? What Should It Do?
Your resume's job is to make you **attractive enough** to land an interview. Think of it as a first impression that gets you a "date" with the recruiter. Whether you ace the interview is another story, but first, your resume must spark interest.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/resume-attractiveness-concept.png" alt="Concept of resume attractiveness" caption="Consider this: Out of all the people you see daily, who catches your eye? The attractive ones, right?" >}}

Consider this: Out of all the people you see daily, who catches your eye? The attractive ones, right? A resume works the same way—it needs **presentation** to grab attention and **content** to prove you're a good fit.

### What Does a Recruiter Look For?
Once your resume piques interest, recruiters want **relevant content** in an easily digestible format. Imagine spending time with *every* person you meet to decide if they're a match—you'd get exhausted and rely on first impressions:

- Dressing sense might hint at culture or social fit.
- Word choice could suggest attitude.
- A smile (or lack thereof) might indicate personality traits.

You're not right every time, but you're right *most* of the time with *least* effort. Recruiters operate similarly.

> **Principle**: Recruiters seek *what you've done* with minimal effort, accepting they might miss some gems.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/recruiter-evaluation-process.jpg" alt="Recruiter evaluation process" caption="As job seekers, we must make their job easy by using simple language, keeping text concise, and avoiding crowded layouts." >}}

As job seekers, we must make their job easy by:

- Using **simple language**.
- Keeping text **concise**.
- Avoiding **crowded layouts**.
- Using **industry keywords** (e.g., deadlocks, race conditions, throughput).
- **Highlighting** key terms.

Software engineers often focus on content but neglect digestibility. This series will simplify and clarify how to shine in both presentation and substance.

## Sections in a Resume

Let's explore the key resume sections, their purpose, and how to make them impactful.

### Objective
> **Principle**: Skip vague mission statements—focus on relevant skills.

**DON'T WRITE THIS SECTION!**

Many write sentimental mission statements like:

- "To do great in life in a high-powered environment…"
- "Give my best to a dynamic organization…"
- "Become a valuable contributor…"

These are a waste of precious resume space. They're abstract and unhelpful for technical roles.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/objective-section-avoid.jpg" alt="Examples of what not to write in objective section" caption="In the software industry, copying such statements is a classic case of 'nakal bina akal' (copying without thinking)." >}}

In the software industry, copying such statements is a classic case of *"nakal bina akal"* (copying without thinking). Recruiters don't care about your life goals—they want **skills relevant to the job**.

Instead, write a **Profile Summary**, e.g.:

- "5 years of software industry experience in the retail domain with Unix admin."
- "Senior editor for ABC magazine, with 2 years' experience managing a 200-person team."
- "Area sales manager for a million-dollar business in the XYZ district."

For non-technical roles like NGOs, mission statements might work. For tech? Skip them.

### Hobbies
> **Idea**: Only include hobbies that add value to the job.

Resumes are high-value real estate. Irrelevant hobbies waste space. Which of these belong on a programmer's resume?

1. Listening to songs
2. Programming for a charitable organization
3. Playing cricket at a national level
4. Teaching English at a college
5. Teaching Data Structures at a college
6. Cooking authentic dishes
7. Contributions to open-source projects

**Answer**: #2, #5, #7. These are directly relevant to programming. If your hobbies don't tie to the job, skip them. No relevant hobbies? No pressure—omit the section.

### Education
> **Principle**: Focus on what matters—relevance over fluff.

Many companies don't care about your college scorecard or the name/city of your school (unless it's a Tier 1 institution). Avoid filler like:

- "Happy College at Joytown, affiliated to Merry University :D"

Use the space for more impactful content.

### Skills
> **Idea**: Highlight key skills clearly and concisely.

This section is **critical**. You can list core skills here and elaborate in the project section, or make it standalone. Either works.

Include:

- **Programming Languages**: Java, C++, C#, Golang
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: Spring, EJB, Groovy, Jersey
- **Tools**: Charles, Git, Jenkins, Docker

Separate high-proficiency skills from average or low ones. Balance is key:

- **Too Few Skills**: May suggest limited experience.
- **Too Many Skills**: Listing every version (e.g., Java 7, 8, 10, 11, 12) or tool (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ, Toad) feels repetitive and dilutes impact.

Group related skills, e.g.:

- Java 7, 8, 12 → "Java"
- DBeaver, Toad, Squirrel → "Relational DB Tools (DBeaver)"
- CVS, Git, Jenkins, Maven → "CI/CD Processes and Tools"

Detail specific tools in the project section.

### Work Details
> **Principle**: Quantify your impact to stand out.

Recruiters want to know **what you've done** with minimal effort. Help them by highlighting your best work clearly.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/work-details-requirements.png" alt="Work details requirements" caption="Recruiters look for: When you worked, Project Overview, and Your Exact Contribution." >}}

Recruiters look for:

1. **When** you worked.
2. **Project Overview**.
3. **Your Exact Contribution**.

The first two are straightforward. The third—quantifying your work—is where many falter. I struggled here until *The Google Resume* taught me to avoid vague terms like "managed" or "worked." Instead, use:

- **Specific Verbs**: Led, improved, coded, designed, implemented.
- **Quantified Impact**: "Led a 5-member team on a $5M project, improving performance by 20%."

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/quantified-impact-examples.png" alt="Examples of quantified impact" caption="Engineers often overlook numbers, but they're critical to sell your profile." >}}

Engineers often overlook numbers, but they're critical to **sell** your profile. Examples:

- "Reduced memory leaks by 15 MB."
- "Improved time complexity from N² to N."
- "Managed a $100K budget."

### Struggling to Quantify Work?
Writing quantified contributions (verb + quantity) is tough initially. It took me three iterations to get it right. Ask yourself:

1. **What Required Effort or Discipline?**
   - Learned a new technology? What, and how long did it take?
   - Was it within your tech domain (e.g., Spring and Hibernate) or outside (e.g., Android and Spring)?
   - Created a tool? How much time did it save?
   - Mastered business basics? How long would it take others?
   - Went beyond your role? E.g., a tester building a testing tool.
   - Solved a problem? How did you ensure the solution was correct?

   {{< figure src="/images/resume-building/effort-discipline-questions.jpg" alt="Questions about effort and discipline" caption="These questions help identify impactful contributions." >}}

2. **How Unique Was Your Work?**
   - Could others in your organization do it? Why not?
   - Could outsiders do it? What made you stand out (tech or business knowledge)?

   {{< figure src="/images/resume-building/uniqueness-assessment.png" alt="Uniqueness assessment" caption="Understanding what makes your work unique helps in quantification." >}}

3. **Did You Earn Recognition?**
   - Was it a team or individual award?
   - Was it ad hoc or scheduled?
   - How does it prove your industry value?

Answering these questions will help you identify impactful contributions. Write them down for your first draft—don't worry about perfection yet.
