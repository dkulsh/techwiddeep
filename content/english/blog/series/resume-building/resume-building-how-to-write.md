# Resume Building: Polishing Your Professional Story

In this series, I'm helping fresh college grads, new joiners, and seasoned professionals across industries understand how to craft resumes that resonate in the real world. With 2020's job market challenges, this is my small contribution to your success. Forget outdated advice like "get good grades, work hard, and you're set"—the job market demands more.

This is part 3 of our resume-building journey, focusing on *how to write*. Having gathered content in previous posts, we'll now edit it for brevity, impact, and clarity. Let's edit!

## Disclaimer

> **Principle**: Transparency builds trust—share what you know and admit what you don't.

I'm not a resume-building expert, nor have I consulted extensively with HR or recruiters.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/how-to-write/disclaimer-note.png" alt="Disclaimer note" caption="This guide reflects real-world experience, not theoretical expertise." >}}

My insights come from conducting and attending multiple interviews, learning from peers, juniors, mentors, and brainstorming with friends. This guide reflects real-world experience, not theoretical expertise.

## Crafting the Right Mindset

> **Idea**: Editing a resume requires a shift from gathering raw details to designing a cohesive, impactful story.

With our content gathered, let's shift to shaping it effectively. Think of the difference between stacking bricks and designing a building. We need to step back from raw details and focus on how they fit together in a logical, digestible, and eye-catching way.

> **Principle**: Separate content creation from content refinement for clarity and focus.

- **Step 1: Gather Raw Details**—Write everything that comes to mind, like a "word vomit" (without being gross).  
- **Step 2: Refine and Structure**—Turn that raw data into polished content.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/how-to-write/editing-pillars.jpg" alt="Editing pillars" caption="Our editing mindset focuses on three pillars: Brevity, Quantification, and Vocabulary." >}}

Our editing mindset focuses on three pillars:

- **Brevity**: Keep statements short and sharp.  
- **Quantification**: Add numbers to show impact.  
- **Vocabulary**: Use industry-specific terms strategically.

---

### Brevity

> **Idea**: Treat resume real estate as high-value—every word must earn its place.

A resume is a compact space for a lot of information. Long, wordy sentences waste space and dilute impact. Consider these examples:

> **Long**: In the process of testing the code, we ran into issues.  
> **Short**: While testing, we ran into issues.

> **Long**: I am a software engineer and I have 5 years of work experience.  
> **Short**: Software engineer with 5 years of work experience.

> **Long**: 73% from St. Marks Senior Secondary School, Jhansi.  
> **Short**: 73%.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/how-to-write/brevity-examples.png" alt="Brevity examples" caption="Notice the fluff: 'The code' adds no value—recruiters assume you're testing code." >}}

Notice the fluff:

- "The code" adds no value—recruiters assume you're testing code.  
- "I am a" and "I have" are redundant; the resume is clearly yours.  
- Unless your school is IIT, IIM, Harvard, or Stanford, its name or "Senior Secondary" status is irrelevant.

> **Principle**: Cut filler words to maximize impact.

If English isn't your strength, don't go it alone—ask a friend with strong language skills for help.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/how-to-write/english-help.jpg" alt="English language help" caption="Don't hesitate to seek help with language skills—it's better to get it right." >}}

### Quantification

> **Idea**: Numbers give context and make your achievements tangible.

Thanks to *The Google Resume*, I learned to quantify my work, transforming vague claims into compelling evidence.

Consider these MBA examples from a successful LinkedIn profile:

> - Invested $2.5M, achieving a 750% ROI in one year.  
> - Improved efficiency by 90%, securing a $1M project.

I hope you think they're strong! Even if you don't know the field, the numbers convey competence. Why? Quantification provides perspective.

> **Principle**: Quantified achievements are easier to understand and more persuasive.

Compare these:

> **Unquantified**: Several years of experience in multiple domains.  
> **Quantified**: 7 years of experience.

> **Unquantified**: Worked to improve the application.  
> **Quantified**: Improved application performance by 5000% with 100 hours of effort.

> **Unquantified**: Handled many big projects.  
> **Quantified**: Worked on 12 projects with an average budget of $1M.

Numbers clarify your work's width, depth, and impact, helping recruiters quickly grasp your value.

As software engineers, we're lucky—our work often yields measurable results (e.g., 30% performance improvement, 50% build time reduction). Use these in your resume!

Struggling to find numbers? Ask these questions:

1. What's the project's cost?  
2. What's the profit (or expected profit) from your work?  
3. What's the data size (millions/billions of records, GB/TB)?  
4. What's the user base size?  
5. How many concurrent users can your system handle?  
6. How much faster did you complete the work compared to others?  
7. How long does the system take to complete tasks, and how much did you improve it?  
8. What's the server cost, number of servers, or deployment scale?  
9. How many hours did automation save?  
10. How many UAT bugs or critical issues did you catch (as a percentage)?

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/how-to-write/quantification-questions.png" alt="Quantification questions" caption="These questions help you identify measurable aspects of your work." >}}

Start asking your manager about project size, dollar value, work hours, or complexity metrics. Doing the work is one thing; presenting it effectively is another.

### Vocabulary

> **Idea**: Use industry-specific terms to showcase expertise, but don't oversimplify technical details.

I've stressed simple language in past blogs, but how do you simplify terms like "thread race condition" or "thread deadlock"?

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/how-to-write/vocabulary-guidelines.png" alt="Vocabulary guidelines" caption="Explaining these in simple terms could fill paragraphs, wasting resume space." >}}

Explaining these in simple terms could fill paragraphs, wasting resume space. So, when should you simplify, and when should you use technical vocabulary?

> **Principle**: Choose industry terms over oversimplification to maintain credibility.

Use terms like:

- Race conditions  
- Deadlocking  
- Performance  
- Network payload  
- Throughput  
- Latency  
- Terabytes/petabytes  
- Server cores  
- Thread starvation  
- Lazy loading  
- Distributed locking  

Don't dilute technical achievements:

- "Resolving race conditions" shouldn't become "made application better."  
- "Terabyte data migration" isn't just "data movement."  
- "Reducing network payload" or "using threading" can't be "made application better."

Two scenarios:

1. A **non-technical recruiter** may not understand the details but will be impressed by your precise vocabulary.  
2. A **technical recruiter** will understand and appreciate the accuracy.

Both work in your favor!

As an example of editing in action: I initially wrote: *"The desire to simplify a resume should NOT be…"* but replaced it with *"Simplification should NOT be…"* for brevity. Small changes like this make a big difference.

## Next Steps

We've explored the mindset for editing a resume: brevity, quantification, and strategic vocabulary. Now, we'll apply these to refine the raw content from our previous blog. We'll shorten sentences, add numbers, and weave in technical terms to make your resume shine.

Until then, happy editing! Share your feedback, like, comment, or reach out with your thoughts.
