## Disclaimer

> **Principle**: Transparency builds trust—share what you know and admit what you don't.

I'm not a resume-building expert, nor have I consulted extensively with HR or recruiters.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/my-edited-resume/disclaimer-note.png" alt="Disclaimer note" caption="This guide reflects real-world experience, not theoretical expertise." >}}

My insights come from conducting and attending multiple interviews, learning from peers, juniors, mentors, and brainstorming with friends. This guide reflects real-world experience, not theoretical expertise.
