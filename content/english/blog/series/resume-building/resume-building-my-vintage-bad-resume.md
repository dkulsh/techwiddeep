# Resume Building: Lessons from My Old Mistakes (Practical Example)

In this series, I'm guiding fresh college grads, early-career professionals, and seasoned tech folks to craft resumes that work in the real world. I share an old, flawed resume from my archives to highlight rookie mistakes. In the next blog, I'll present my latest resume, showcasing the contrast to demonstrate:

- Common errors made by a novice job hunter.
- The lack of content, presentation, and confidence in a poorly crafted resume.
- The strength of these qualities in a polished resume.

If you've made similar mistakes, take heart—find your courage! This blog shows how easy it is for an undirected soul to stumble, but the next will prove how a directed approach can turn things around. *It's okay to make mistakes*, as long as you learn and improve. Let's begin my walk of shame!

## Disclaimer

> **Principle**: Transparency builds trust—share what you know and admit what you don't.

I'm not a resume-building expert, nor have I consulted extensively with HR or recruiters.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/my-vintage-bad-resume/disclaimer-note.png" alt="Disclaimer note" caption="This guide reflects real-world experience, not theoretical expertise." >}}

My insights come from conducting and attending multiple interviews, learning from peers, juniors, mentors, and brainstorming with friends. This guide reflects real-world experience, not theoretical expertise.

## Profile Summary

> **Idea**: A vague, unquantified summary fails to impress recruiters.

Let's start with the summary section of my old resume, where the mistakes are glaring.

*This section illuminates us about the fact that I am a software engineer (big surprise), and that I'd like to do good in life (wow! that's unique). And that's it … the summary wanted to leave the party sober.*

*And couldn't I have used bigger font size, because, of course, difficult reading makes for happy recruiters.*

## Skills

> **Idea**: Vague, text-heavy skills dilute your expertise.

Having worked many years in the industry, this is all I came up with:

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/my-vintage-bad-resume/skills-mistakes.png" alt="Skills section mistakes" caption="With so much text and vague details, I was trying to overwhelm the recruiter with boredom!" >}}

With so much text and vague details, I was trying to overwhelm the recruiter with boredom!

## Projects

> **Idea**: Unquantified, vague projects fail to showcase your impact.

The gloom continues in the project section:

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/my-vintage-bad-resume/projects-mistakes-1.png" alt="Project section mistakes - Example 1" caption="First example of project section mistakes." >}}

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/my-vintage-bad-resume/projects-mistakes-2.png" alt="Project section mistakes - Example 2" caption="Second example of project section mistakes." >}}

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/my-vintage-bad-resume/projects-mistakes-3.png" alt="Project section mistakes - Example 3" caption="Third example of project section mistakes." >}}

**Mistakes**:
- No quantification whatsoever!
- Personal contributions are vague (e.g., caching *relevant* data, data access patterns).
- Minimal technical vocabulary, failing to appeal to technical recruiters.
- Incomplete details (e.g., rewriting queries), unhelpful for non-technical recruiters.
- Dense text that few recruiters would bother to read.

## Employment

> **Principle**: Redundant details waste valuable resume space.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/my-vintage-bad-resume/employment-mistakes.png" alt="Employment section mistakes" caption="This section isn't terrible, but it repeats details from projects and skills, wasting space." >}}

This section isn't terrible, but it repeats details from projects and skills, wasting space.

## Turning Obstacles into Opportunities

> **Principle**: Mistakes are learning opportunities—persistence and feedback lead to improvement.

These mistakes seem silly now, but consider this:

> - This resume belonged to a top performer in their team and organization.
> - The same skills and projects were transformed into a stellar portfolio through failure and learning.
> - For each unresponded application, I called recruiters to understand why my profile was overlooked. Each piece of feedback helped me refine my resume.
> - After correcting these mistakes, I received more interview calls than I could handle. My phone was ringing off the hook, and I missed lunchtimes due to packed interview schedules.

*It's okay for an undirected soul to make blunders*, as long as they keep learning. The polished resume in the next blog is the result of failures, feedback, and relentless improvement.
