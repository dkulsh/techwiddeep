# Resume Building: Polishing Your Visual Story

In this series, I'm guiding fresh college grads, new joiners, and professionals across industries to craft resumes that shine in the real world. This is part 5 of our resume-building journey, focusing on *beautification*. We'll polish our resume's presentation to grab attention and leave a lasting impression. Let's make it visually compelling!

## Disclaimer

> **Principle**: Transparency builds trust—share what you know and admit what you don't.

I'm not a resume-building expert, nor have I consulted extensively with HR or recruiters.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/beautify/disclaimer-note.png" alt="Disclaimer note" caption="This guide reflects real-world experience, not theoretical expertise." >}}

My insights come from conducting and attending multiple interviews, learning from peers, juniors, mentors, and brainstorming with friends. This guide reflects real-world experience, not theoretical expertise.

## Adding Chutzpah

> **Idea**: A resume with bold, unique presentation stands out in a sea of sameness.

Let's explore how to make your resume visually stand out. Truth be told, I'm not skilled at design or high-end presentation. With countless "ready-to-use" templates online, it's tempting to plug in content and call it a day. But this often leads to awkward, uninspired resumes.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/beautify/visual-standout.jpg" alt="Visual standout approach" caption="A head HR once told me, 'Deep, I like the way you presented your skills. You know, I like people with some chutzpah.'" >}}

A head HR once told me, "Deep, I like the way you presented your skills. You know, I like people with some *chutzpah*." (Truth be told, I was flattered!) *Chutzpah*—spelled with a "c" and pronounced with gusto—means confidence, nerve, or boldness. She meant my resume broke the mold of standard presentation.

How did I, with limited design skills, earn that compliment? I asked myself simple questions:

- How can my resume stand out in a crowd?  
- How can I avoid a boring layout?  
- What looks interesting *and* professional?

These questions led to a resume that felt authentic and eye-catching.

## Thinking Out Loud

> **Idea**: Thoughtful design choices make your resume memorable and recruiter-friendly.

Let's explore specific visual enhancements I've used in my resume:

### Experience
I started with a timeline and image for my work experience:

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/beautify/experience-timeline.jpg" alt="Experience timeline" caption="This format worked initially, but I later refined both content and design." >}}

This format worked initially, but I later refined both content and design:

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/beautify/experience-refined.jpg" alt="Experience refined" caption="Both formats have merit, but adding a new role made the second, simpler format more effective." >}}

Both formats have merit, but adding a new role made the second, simpler format more effective. *It's okay to keep improving*—iteration is part of the process.

### Work Locations
To highlight my onsite experience, I added a map of work locations (Minneapolis, US; Bangalore, India; Delhi, India):

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/beautify/work-locations-map.jpg" alt="Work locations map" caption="This depiction worked a few times but lost impact over time, so I removed it after a few months." >}}

This depiction worked a few times but lost impact over time, so I removed it after a few months. Flexibility is key—test and adapt.

### Skills
I invested effort in a visual, timeline-based depiction of my skills:

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/beautify/skills-timeline.jpg" alt="Skills timeline" caption="Using text-filled images helped non-technical recruiters." >}}

Using text-filled images helped non-technical recruiters. This worked for a while, but I later simplified it:

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/beautify/skills-simplified.png" alt="Skills simplified" caption="The simpler version feels cleaner and more effective." >}}

The simpler version feels cleaner and more effective. Continuous improvement isn't about "fixing mistakes" but evolving what works.

### Projects
Here's the final version of my project section after multiple edits:

| Project | Client Onboarding – Performance and Code Refactoring |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Tech Stack** | Android, Couchbase, LeakCanary, Everit JSON Schema Validation |
| **Description** | **Task**: Refactor code and improve app performance<br>- **Resolved 18 MB memory leak** from the app.<br>- **Reduced method call duplications, chaining, and eager loading**, improving app performance by **10%**.<br>- **Un-nested UI view hierarchy and reduced overdraws**, achieving a **70% performance improvement** and earning **CEO appreciation**.<br>- **Optimized object creations** (e.g., "new Gson()"), reducing method time from **44 ms to 3 ms**.<br>- **Rewrote AsyncTasks** to use executeOnExecutor for better hardware performance.<br>- Reconfigured data structures to reduce memory and CPU consumption.<br>- Integrated magnetic swipe hardware into the application. |
| **Role** | - Individual contributor/programmer. |

**Notes**:
- The table adds structure, making it easier to read.
- Numbers and key ideas are **underlined** for emphasis.
- The project's main goal is summarized in one line with **highlighted text**.

## Wrapping Up

> **Principle**: A polished resume blends content and visuals to tell a compelling story.

This concludes our resume-building series. I hope it's clear that crafting a resume is *hard but not complicated*. As I shared initially, I struggled to learn the "rights" and "wrongs" of resume writing:

1. I wanted to focus on tech skills but spent disproportionate time on resume books, blogs, templates, and images.
2. Even after learning best practices (brevity, quantification), I lacked the "mental muscle" to apply them. As a junior engineer, I wasn't trained to track project dollars or impact, and I had no mentor.

This series distills books, blogs, experience, failures, and successes into a guide that's **easy for a layman to understand**.

### Success Looks Like:
You, as a non-expert, understanding resume-building essentials, creating a solid resume, and feeling confident in days.

{{< figure src="/images/resume-building/beautify/success-looks-like.png" alt="Success looks like" caption="The next two blogs will showcase a poorly made version and a well-edited version of my resume." >}}

The next two blogs will showcase:
1. A poorly made version of my resume.
2. A well-edited version of my resume.

These will highlight the value of our approach. Let's move on!
