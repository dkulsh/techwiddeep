#### How “Size of a reward/ punishment” affects cooperation at IT companies

---

#### Recap …

Achieving cooperation and delivering is a priority for IT companies.

As part of this blog series, we look at “systematic” concepts that help achieve cooperation. We’ve already looked at:

- [**Detection of behavior**]({{< relref "quick-detection.md" >}})
- [**Nature of rewards**]({{< relref "nature-of-incentives.md" >}})
- [**Clarity**]({{< relref "clarity.md" >}})
- [**Certainty**]({{< relref "certainty.md" >}})

Today we talk about…

---

#### Size

The **size** of a reward or penalty should be **proportional to the size of the contribution** (or lack thereof).

> Let a thief go, and he steals again. (If a punishment is too small, it isn’t effective.)  
> Kill a thief and other thieves start killing. (If a punishment is too big, it triggers worse behaviour.)


##### A general rule is – Keep it conservative.

- A **reward** should be large enough to **encourage work**,  
  and small enough to **avoid Greed and Pride**.

- A **penalty** should be large enough to **deter the behavior**,  
  and small enough to **keep the players in the game**.

#### Too Big Rewards

Big rewards have blind spots – **Greed and Ego**, for starters.

> Handling success requires humility. The feeling of “I have arrived” can ruin careers, projects, and more.

Fall from grace has been common among **Kings, Presidents, Bureaucrats, Politicians, Film Stars**, etc. While talent and hard work do take them to the top, **many aren’t able to handle success**.



> It takes a special someone to keep working with the same humility **despite** the rewards — not **because** of them.

##### Double Salary

Priyanka joined as a Business Analyst with a product-based organization. Bright and energetic, she did good work and was noticed.

Next appraisal – she was promoted to a **PM role** and her **salary was doubled**.  
**Priyanka had arrived!**

Everyone noticed that she suddenly became ‘edgy’. Her **requests turned into orders** and **remarks**.  
Certain tasks suddenly became *‘beneath her’*.

- The gaps became someone else’s faults  
- Statements like **“Why should I”** and **“Not my responsibility”** were thrown around  
- Her projects started **lagging**

A few more months and the **blue-eyed PM quit the organization** (or was asked to).

> The size of the reward was too big and too soon for Priyanka.  
> Since the organization rewarded her disproportionately, it was as much responsible for her failure as she was.

#### Too Big Penalties

Why are criminals arrested, and not just shot dead? Even when guilt is clear, convicts are **arrested and taken to court**. Why?

Think about this scenario:

- If all criminls are to be shot dead…  
  
  Then why not cause the even bigger damage when they can ? Since the **penalty would be the biggest**, why not go for the **biggest damage**.

> When people have nothing to lose, they go all-out crazy — causing **more destruction**.

##### The same applies to software engineers.

If an engineer is **threatened to be fired** for the first production bug:

- No engineer would be willing to work  
**OR**
- Projects will never get completed  

If you understand this, it’s because you know that **bugs are always possible**.

> **penalties must be practically sized** for successful deterrence.

Imagine a guy working on back-to-back production issues. Would it make sense to punish him for being late to office?  

**Of course not!**

Someone fighting for survival should be **cut slack on hygiene practices**.

I would get pissed at such a reprimand.  
And might plan to **leave the organization** altogether.

###### Reminder on the general rule:

> Keep it conservative — penalties need to be of the **smallest effective size**.

---

#### Right Size ??

How do we know the **right size** of a reward or penalty?

To be honest, I am not fully sure. But I know a **working analogy**.

##### Eating

> When eating, how do I know when I am full?  
> Well, my **stomach tells me**!

- Too much food → my stomach **complains**  
- Too little food → it **demands more**

All I have to do is **Listen**.

> In the same way, to get the right-sized reward for a techie, all a leader has to do is — **See / Listen / Perceive**.

---

#### Wrap up

The **Size** of a reward or penalty is the **next piece of the puzzle**.

> Like eating, too many rewards lead to **obesity**, and too little to **anorexia**.  
> Both conditions cause **detriment to health** — not only of the techie but also of the organization.

**Proportionate rewards and penalties** are the next pillars in an IT organization.
