#### How “Repeat engagement” affects cooperation at IT companies

---

##### Recap …

Achieving cooperation and delivering is a **priority** for IT companies.

As part of this blog series, we look at **“systematic” concepts** that help achieve cooperation. We’ve looked at:

- [**Detection of behavior**]({{< relref "quick-detection.md" >}})
- [**Nature of rewards**]({{< relref "nature-of-incentives.md" >}})
- [**Clarity**]({{< relref "clarity.md" >}})
- [**Certainty**]({{< relref "certainty.md" >}})
- [**Size**]({{< relref "size.md" >}})


Today we talk about …

#### **Repetition**

##### Why is most food of a poor quality at tourist attractions?

The food is **not cheap**. In fact, it's sometimes **outrageous** for the value.

We purchased from a family grocer for almost 40 years!  Received the best quality products, with the best discounts. All without asking!

I'm sure you’ve already figured it out.  

**Key is – Repetition.**

Let’s say a restaurant serves a poor meal at a tourist spot :

- They serve 50 tourists today. They get 50 new tourists tomorrow!  
Because there's **no repeat business**, there's **hardly any disincentive** for today’s poor service.

- Let’s say I was one of their scapegoats – what am I going to do?  
**Not come again.** But my chances of revisiting the tourist spot are nil anyway.

On the other hand:

- Our family grocer had a **big disincentive** while cheating.  
He would’ve lost **repeat business**.

> **Repeat business is so important that it is a success metric!**  
> The prospect of future losses offsets the temptation to cheat now.

#### **Tech Companies**

The same idea applies to techies.  

**Continuation of engagement/employment drives quality of work.**

- If the **org plans to let me go**, then:  
  - Rewarding me is an avoidable expense.  
  - Penalizing me is an avoidable hassle.

- If **I plan to move on**, then:  
  - Incentives are a lucky lottery.  
  - Penalties are forgettable mishaps.

In the same breath:

- If **I wish to stay** with an organization for long, **I will avoid cheating and want to deliver**.  
- If an **org intends to retain me**, it will avoid cheating and **reward well**.

#### **Litmus Test**

> Repetition is used as a **litmus test**, across the industry.

##### For an Organization:

If an employee has had a **lengthy tenure**, then he has almost certainly performed above a threshold.

- Ability to deliver  
- Dependability  

The lengthy tenure guy **HAD to have delivered at some point**. Whereas the fickle one might’ve only hopped from one responsibility to another.

> A **less talented but loyal** employee might be valuable than a **sharp but unreliable** one.

**To employees switching jobs every year:**

Your experience does NOT prove your abilities.  

Unless you prove talent another way, **you are of poor value** to an org. Good orgs will avoid you — despite your talent.

---

##### For an Employee:

If an organization has had **lengthy employee tenures**, then it has certainly done some things right.

- Good leadership/management  
- Care

> A **reliable but low-paying org** is more desirable than a **high-paying unreliable one**.

The good org HAD to deliver quality management at some point.  The churn-heavy ones might have just **cycled through people**.



**To orgs churning employees:**

Your total number of years does NOT prove your standing.  Unless you prove management abilities another way, you are of poor value to an employee.  

Good employees will avoid you — despite your high salaries.

#### **Review Sites**

Technology has played a **BIG** role in enabling repetition.

Think of review sites:

- Yelp  
- Glassdoor  
- Google Reviews  
- Amazon  
- Goodreads  

They create a **memory of past behavior** — introducing **repetition where there was none**.

##### Earlier –

An organization could trick employees. The **next batch** would be **fresh tourists to be fooled again**.

##### Now –

Reviews on Glassdoor create a memory of the tricking.  New employees hesitate to join toxic organizations. 

The org **loses good talent**, and therefore, **business**.

> Review sites have **increased the cost of stupidity**.  
> By introducing **memory**.

#### **Wrap Up**

**Repetition is the last pillar** to achieve cooperation at an IT company.  

> Choices between a **long-term** and a **short-term** game become very different, even for the **same players**.

In the spirit of repetition — here’s a recap of the **6 pillars** for getting cooperation at an IT org:

- Quick Detection of behavior  
- Nature of rewards/punishments  
- Clarity  
- Certainty  
- Size  
- Repetition

---

**Missed timelines, delayed projects, stretching programs, over-budget portfolios** are common in the IT industry.

Systems like **performance reviews, HR practices, rewards** help — but any system **missing these pillars becomes dysfunctional.**

**Happy team building!**
