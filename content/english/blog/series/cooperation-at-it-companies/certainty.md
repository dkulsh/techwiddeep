#### How “Certainty” helps achieve cooperation at IT companies.

---

#### Recap …

Achieving cooperation and delivering is a priority for IT companies.

As part of this blog series, we look at “systematic” concepts that help achieve cooperation. We’ve looked at …

- [**Detection of behavior**]({{< relref "quick-detection.md" >}})
- [**Nature of rewards**]({{< relref "nature-of-incentives.md" >}})
- [**Clarity**]({{< relref "clarity.md" >}})


Today we talk about …

---

#### Certainty

Employees should have **confidence** that good behavior will be rewarded. And that bad will be punished.  
>The **higher** this confidence, the **higher** the cooperation.

##### Lucky draw

I worked with a large MNC for many years. Many times, my performance was pretty good (staying modest).
However, I wasn’t always rewarded.

**Reasons?**

- Allotted appraisal slots were filled.  
- A new rule got created adding to the requirements.  
- My manager had other favorites.  

After 100% of hard work, my chances of getting rewarded stood around **20 – 30%**.  

This was a **de-motivating** factor. Not just for me but for all others too.

**After a few iterations … Did we work hard anymore?**  No !

---

The same thing happened with **punishments**.  

When I was lethargic or wrote poor quality code:

- My stature could get me off.  
- After months, the incident could just be forgotten. (Appraisals are a 6 monthly affair)  

Once again – After 100% of laziness, my chances of getting punished stood around **20 – 30%**.

**Did the system encourage lethargy?**  
**Of course!**

> Certainty triggers cooperation.  
> And uncertainty triggers collusion.

#### Countries behavior

International agreements like **Trade** fall under the purview of WTO (World Trade Organization).

When one country complains that another has cheated on a trade agreement. For example:

- Donald Trump complains that China manipulates its currency to help their exports. But nothing happens.  
- India (land of Basmati and Turmeric) had to fight a legal battle for the copyright of the same products.

Then, the WTO initiates an administrative process that drags on for months or years. **Facts of the case have little bearing on the judgment** — it usually depends more on **international politics and diplomacy**.

Due to the **uncertainty and delay** – such enforcement procedures are **NOT effective**.  

The same goes for techies at IT companies.

##### Penny wise Pound foolish

I worked with a software company.  

They promised me a **‘reward’** for delivering a difficult project. My reward would’ve been in the range of ~5000 $.

End of the project, they suddenly came up with an excuse – **financial troubles**.  

I moved on to greener pastures. But the company did not realize that – **most employees had become sluggish**.

Employees weren’t **certain** whether their work would be rewarded anymore.  

This reduced overall productivity. The loss could be quantified in the range of **~1,000,000 $**.

> The org saved some thousands, only to lose a million!  
> **Penny wise, pound foolish!**

---

#### Wrap up

**Certainty is important.**  

My probability of being punished drives my **risk appetite**.

The **same rewards/ penalties** with a **high degree of certainty** drive **higher cooperation**.

- **20% chance of reward** – Hard work doesn’t seem enticing enough.  
- **20% chance of punishment** – Laziness doesn’t seem problematic enough.
