#### How “Type of a Reward” Helps Achieve Cooperation at IT Companies

---

#### **Backstory**

Achieving cooperation and delivering is a priority for IT companies.

As part of this blog series, we look at *“systematic”* concepts that help achieve cooperation.  
We’ve looked at:

- [**Detection of behavior**]({{< relref "quick-detection.md" >}})

Today we talk about…

- **Nature of rewards/punishments**

---

#### **What the Organization Thought Was a Reward...**

The subject is best described with real-life examples. So, here we go…

---

##### **Promoted to Quit**

I was managing a very difficult project — taking care of technical, managerial, design, architecture, client engagement, and other aspects.

The right people became happy. And leadership promoted me to a **‘Manager’** position.

**2 months later – I quit the job.**

> What the organization assumed was a reward, to me, was a **punishment**!

---

##### **Why?**

There are **Techies** and there are **Managers**. Both add value and are needed at IT organizations.

A common idea is — **a manager supersedes an engineer**.

Personally, I have been interested in **technical work**. I do not have the aptitude or interest to be a manager.

So, to me – the idea that _“a manager supersedes an engineer”_ is just **managerial hubris**.

---

##### **Management Without Skin in the Game**

When done in a standalone manner – Tech Management has no **“Skin in the Game”**.  

> Growth gets stunted without 'Skin in the Game'.

If you’ve seen managers use a lot of complex words to discuss a simple problem — then you’ve witnessed this concept in action.

---

Back to the subject...

The **promotion** was assumed to be a **reward**. When in fact, it was a **punishment for me!**

###### Point Being – Understanding the Nature of Rewards is Important.

---

#### **Common Organizational Rewards**

Let us look at the various ways organizations “reward” employees:

1. **Paying more $$**  
   Performance bonus, salary hike, etc.

2. **Promotions**  
   A better job title, more responsibilities, bigger team to supervise

3. **Social Stature**  
   Appreciation months, employee of the month programs, social credit – LinkedIn appreciations, etc.

4. **Team Building**  
   Bowling alleys, dinners, parties, and other activities

---

But each reward has a **“next-level” effect**.

Such an effect, while important, is less understood.  

Here’s another story to understand …

---

##### **Social Outcast**

The Director of an org told me that he wanted to **“overload his employees”**.

He explained — since single youngsters did not have many other things to do, they could (and did) contribute more to the organization.

One of his “bright boys” was a guy named **Nikhil**.  
The poster boy did nothing but work — day and night, weekdays and weekends.

Of course, he was rewarded for the work with faster promotion and salary hikes.

---

Sounds fair, right?

But — **devil in the details.** Remember the **“next-level” effect**…

---

##### **Message to Team: Work 24x7 to Get Appreciation**

Few could compete with Nikhil’s work ethic. So, most did **not** get their deserved promotions.
Many **quit**.

Also, once the team found out that **Nikhil was responsible for them receiving poor bonuses**, they implemented **social sanctions** on him.

This brought down **team productivity**.

Of course, the director did not realize that Nikhil had become a **social outcast**.

---

#### **An Outlier + Comparative Rewards = Reduced Team Productivity**

> Rewards **cannot be comparative** to an outlier.
> 
> And the **visibility (nature) of rewards** is important.

---

##### **My Take:**
Being the nerd that he was — rewarding Nikhil in **silo** would’ve been a better idea.

---

#### **Nature of Punishments**

Exactly the same way, the **“nature of punishments”** matters too.

---

##### **Incorrect Punishment**

I’ve written about a techie called **Rahul**.  
He was a Director at an organization and an **underperformer**.

Of course, he wasn’t able to deliver on his tasks. And then used to choose the next best option — get help in the name of “teamwork”.

He called his subordinates and asked them to put in long hours. **Rahul’s team bore the added burden** of what he failed to do.

---

Rahul was reprimanded.  
But he did **not** care.

His behavior invited **social sanctions**.  
But he did **not** care.

---

##### **Why? Wrong Type of Punishment**

What would’ve happened in case Rahul wasn’t helped?

Sure, deliverables would've been delayed and client would've been upset.

But Rahul would’ve had to stay up long nights, all by himself. Right?

I bet he would’ve either quit or made corrections.
And **everyone would’ve been better off.**


> You see — **The nature of the punishment matters.**

---

#### **Wrap Up**

People want (or avoid) different things…

- Challenging work  
- Work-from-home flexibility  
- More time  
- Compensation  
- Job titles  
- Social status  
- ...and more.

---

Achieving cooperation requires the **right incentives** or **disincentives**.

> As they say: **To each thy own!**
