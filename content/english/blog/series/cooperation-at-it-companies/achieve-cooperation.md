> *"Achieving cooperation and delivering is a priority for IT companies. Their bread and butter too!"*

And yet, Missed timelines, delayed projects, stretching programs, over-budgeted portfolios — all too common.

---

#### 🛠️ The "Systems" Created to Solve These

To address these, organizations come up with **systems** like:

- Bonuses  
- Performance reviews  
- HR practices  
- Team exercises  
- Parties, excursions, etc.  

These are all meant to **build teams** — and *cooperation*.

#### 🔍 What This Blog Series Is About

As part of this blog series, we'll look at **"systematic" concepts** that aim to achieve cooperation.

But we'll **start with what DOESN'T work.**

---

#### 💸 Bonuses

**Bonus:** A monetary incentive for a certain behaviour.

##### 🤔 Let's Ask a Few Questions:

- What behaviour should an IT company reward?
  - Faster delivery – even if with some bugs?
  - Quality delivery (zero P1 bugs) – even if delayed?
  - Scalable design – with added development cost?
  - More lines of code – even when it's repeated?
  - Meeting timelines?
  - Documentation?

> Answering these is **NOT easy** — because companies go through cycles where the desired behaviour **changes**.

##### 🔄 Changing Scenarios

- A startup needs **fast delivery**, while a large org prefers **quality**. And a startup might mature into a large company.
- A large company might have a project needing **startup-style agility**.
- Fast delivery might mean **zero documentation**, but …
- A handover or attrition might demand **extensive documentation**.

**So how do you give the bonus?**  

Do we reward **different behaviours every time**?

#### 📋 Appraisal Reviews


Performance review months at IT companies are the **most unusual times**.

- **English** suddenly becomes the language of communication.  

  Especially among vernacular speakers. (Vernacular is casual — but not during appraisals!)

- **Regular meetings** stretch unnecessarily.  
  
  'Review' meetings are short — *discomforting* for both sides.

- **Eye contact? Avoided.** (Lest it reveals too much!)

🌿  _Like Autumn, the greenery in the office fades — in anticipation of the coming winter._

- A lot of **HR meetings** happen.
- **Coffee-time gossip** floats around.
- Folks of the same designation **huddle in whispers**.
- A **curtain** builds between *"us" and "them"*.

It's a time for **revenge**, **grievances**, **proving** — and sometimes *anything but performance reviews*.

##### 🧠 But Why? What's Broken?


###### 🖥️ The Virtual Nature of Software

We **cannot see, touch, or feel** software.  
This puts us at a **major disadvantage** while evaluating code or a developer.

> This is a *MAJOR* reason why performance reviews are so difficult.

📝 *Detailed post:* [Why IT industry is fertile ground for Cheatcodes]

###### 👤 Human Variables

Humans are **complex**. Our experiences and preferences make us imperfect.

Some issues with performance reviews:

- **Being Judged is Discomforting**  
  Imagine an Indian girl dressing up to meet a guy's family.  
  She'll describe it as anxious, stressful, tense.  
  Being judged at work? *No different.*

- **Comparison**  
  *Apples to oranges* — it happens, and is **wasteful**.

- **Biases**  
  Dress code sometimes gets more weight than the **actual code**.

- **Only Critiques, No Suggestions**  
  Criticism is easy. Suggestions? Not so much.  
  Appraisals often become a **humiliation exercise**.

- **One-sided**  
- **Standard / Bureaucratic**  
- **Phony Feedback**

> And **IT companies depend on these** for growth.  
> A system so flawed is at best **unhelpful**, and at worst **hypocritical**.

##### 🎉 Team Building — Parties, Excursions

Next up — the **HR playbook**:

- Bowling events  
- Dine-outs  
- Paintball  
- Secret Santa  
- Treasure hunts  
- Cultural events  

✅ These **do** build camaraderie.  
❌ But only like **going to the gym once a quarter** builds your body!

> These events help — but are too **rare** to be effective.

**My view?**  
Team building events delay **attrition**, and *that's it*.  
Raising productivity? *Too far-fetched*.

#### 🧭 To BE or Not To Be?

With all the flaws of:

- Bonuses  
- Appraisals  
- Team Building events  

**Do we abandon them?**

**I disagree.**  Abandoning these creates a **socialist** structure:  
- No disincentive to be lazy  
- No incentive to work hard  

No software company can survive that.

🧊 Remember the Soviet Union?  

Everyone had the **same risk** of going to the Gulags. So — everyone stopped working!

> Why work hard and get jailed… when you could be lazy and still end up in Siberia?

Same logic applies in an IT company.

#### 🏗️ So, what do we do ?

**Redesign the systems** — but with the **right characteristics**.
