#### How quick 'detection' of behaviour helps achieve cooperation at IT companies

---

##### **Backstory**

Achieving co-operation and delivering is a priority for IT companies. Their bread and butter too!

Missed timelines, delayed projects, stretching programs, over-budgeted portfolios are common — especially in IT.

To solve these problems, organizations create systems like performance bonuses, HR practices, team exercises, parties, and excursions.  

All of this is aimed at one thing — **building co-operation**.

As part of this blog series, we look at *systematic* concepts that achieve cooperation — or ought to.

Continuing from [_How to Achieve Co-operation_]({{< relref "achieve-cooperation.md" >}}) , we now begin with **Pillar 1**.

#### **Quick Detection of Behaviour**

If I, a software developer, am being lazy — then before I can be punished, my cheating **must be detected**.  

Even more importantly, it must be detected **quickly**.

If detection is **fast and accurate**, then the **punishment or reward** can also be **immediate and accurate**.

- If I cheat, quick punishment reduces my benefit and increases the cost.
- If I perform well, a quick reward increases my ROI.

> Immediacy increases the likelihood of cooperation in an organization.

On the flip side, if performance is rewarded too late, I might think the reward is due to other factors —  
like luck, attendance, or just being visible.

##### **Pavlov's Experiment**

A classic example: **Pavlov's dogs**.

Ivan Pavlov rang a bell each time he fed his dogs. At first, they salivated at the sight of food.  

But soon, they began to salivate **just by hearing the bell** — they associated sound with food.

Now imagine if the food came **hours** after the bell. Would the dogs behave the same way?  
**Nope !**

> If the stimulant and stimulus are too far apart, the behaviour doesn't stick.

**Same goes for software engineers.**

---

#### **Quick Detection**

Let's take an example.

You have a team of 10 developers. **Deep is a lazy one!**

His code is buggy, doesn't handle all cases, is late, and poorly designed.

Now if Deep's lead quickly escalates the issue. And management reviews it fast, then:

- Deep gets **immediate feedback**.
- He is **reprimanded within days**.
- The **ROI on his lethargy is low**, and chances are, Deep corrects himself quickly.

> But wait a full year for a performance review?
>
> The ROI of being lazy becomes **HUGE**.

---

#### **Slow Detection**

Let's say some devs in the same team start **colluding**.  

They strike a deal with the Lead — hide their issues in exchange for extra effort when needed.

They learn how to **divert accountability**:

- Pass questions to Product Owners.
- Blame Business Analysts.
- Escalate to Architects or Managers.

> Think this doesn't happen in big organisations ? Think again.

Now, cheating becomes **multi-dimensional**:

- MVP version
- Delivery timelines
- Code quality
- Requirements shifting
- Team inter-dependencies
- Internal politics
- Process workarounds

**Leadership can't monitor everything. Period !**

So detection happens late — giving more room to slack off.

Even capable leaders may only review end-stage deliverables like:

- Bug counts
- Client feedback
- Software polish

---

###### **Even more Complexity!**

Unfortunately, even the above signals aren't reliable:

- A client may give bad feedback to promote a **competitor**.
- Product Owners may not understand **tech quality**.
- Bugs might be **out of scope**.

> Slow and partial detection === High temptation to cheat.

This issue plagues **large IT firms** like Infosys, TCS, Cognizant, Wipro — you name it.

When systems detect issues **late**, **lazy behaviour becomes incentivized**.

---

#### **The Scale Problem**

Take an org with ~100 employees and a 5-layer hierarchy.

Management now has to figure out:

- **Has cheating occurred?**
- **At which layer(s)?**
- **Who was involved?**

This is on top of:

- Collusion  
- Complexity  
- Monitoring limits  
- Accountability gaps

> Slow answers === High incentives to cheat.

This is not an isolated problem. It's **systemic** in all large companies.

---

#### **Wrap Up**

To generate co-operation in an IT company, **quick detection** is essential.

**Annual or quarterly reviews**?  Forget about it !!

> A good performance system **must include quick detection of behaviour**.
