**In the world of software, have we ever thought about how software companies work?**

**Let's try to understand by looking at a software company like a machine—one that produces code.**

#### First Parts

To begin, let's explore the initial components of this machine.

| ![](/images/software-building-machine/client-icon.png) | #### Client These are the people who need problems solved. They speak human language and don't know technology. |
| --- | --- |

| ![](/images/software-building-machine/business-analyst-icon.png) Speaks green and blue language | #### Business Analyst (Translator) These people are multilingual. They speak both human and technology. Their job is to translate one language to another. |
| --- | --- |

##### 20 Feet Picture

Clients provide business requirements (in green language). Business analysts translate them to technical requirements (in blue language).

---

With the requirements translated, an expert steps in to guide the process.

| ![](/images/software-building-machine/architect-icon.png) Speaks green and blue language | #### Architect This person is also multilingual. They help create rules so that minimal effort produces the maximum result. Their qualification is having made lots of mistakes and knowing how *not* to make them. |
| --- | --- |

The architect creates a template (or rules) that gives the maximum output with the minimum input.

##### 50 Feet Picture

Combining what we've understood so far, we have:

Clients (giving requirements) -> Analyst (translating) -> Architect (making rules)

Building on this foundation, we introduce the core production team.

| ![](/images/software-building-machine/software-engineer-icon.png) | #### Software Engineer They speak only technical language (blue) and know how to write code. |
| --- | --- |

| ![](/images/software-building-machine/tech-lead-icon.png) | #### Tech Lead With some experience, they know more about writing code than software engineers do. |
| --- | --- |

and

| ![](/images/software-building-machine/manager-icon.png) | #### Manager Responsible for oiling the machine so all parts run smoothly (and without friction). |
| --- | --- |

A lead will work with a manager and many software engineers...

...as well as with other leads.

##### 100 Feet Picture

Leads and engineers use the business requirements and the rules to start producing code.

Next, we ensure the quality of the output.

| ![](/images/software-building-machine/testing-team-icon.png) | #### Testing Team Responsible for finding mistakes with the code. |
| --- | --- |

| ![](/images/software-building-machine/bugs-icon.png) | #### Bugs Mistakes with the code. |
| --- | --- |

The testing team looks for any issues with the code. If they find issues, they are sent to the developers and leads for fixing.

The cycle repeats until the code is good enough.

##### 500 Feet Picture

Here is the picture from raw requirements to buggy code.

Finally, we verify the end product.

| ![](/images/software-building-machine/quality-filter-icon.png) | #### Quality Filter Verifying whether the code behaves as the client expects it to. |
| --- | --- |

| ![](/images/software-building-machine/signoff-icon.png) | #### Signoff Approval from the client that the code works as expected. |
| --- | --- |

And this is how a software-producing machine works!
