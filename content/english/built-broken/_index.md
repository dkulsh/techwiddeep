# Built & Broken

Welcome to my technical projects showcase. This section contains detailed accounts of the code, systems, and projects I've built throughout my career. Each project includes:

- **Real-world impact** - Actual performance improvements and business value delivered
- **Technical details** - Architecture decisions, implementation challenges, and solutions
- **Lessons learned** - What worked, what didn't, and key takeaways
- **Code examples** - Practical implementations and optimization techniques

These aren't theoretical exercises or toy projects - they're production systems that handled real traffic, solved real problems, and delivered measurable business value. From crypto exchange optimizations to e-commerce performance improvements, each project represents a unique engineering challenge and solution.

Whether you're looking for inspiration for your own projects, want to understand how to approach similar problems, or are curious about the technical side of building scalable systems, you'll find practical insights and real-world examples here.
