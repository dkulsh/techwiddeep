# Building a Smart Resume Keyword Analyzer: My End-to-End Project Journey

Over the past few months, I worked on a project that combined backend
development, machine learning, and frontend engineering to solve a
real-world problem many job seekers face: missing out on opportunities
simply because their resumes don't have the "right" keywords. Modern
resume screening algorithms (ATS -- Applicant Tracking Systems) often
reject candidates who are perfectly capable, but lack a few crucial
words in their profile. My project set out to fix this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Idea

The project started with a simple observation: job postings are full of
signals that candidates need to understand better. These signals include
**technical skills, interpersonal skills, and domain-specific
requirements**. If we could extract, analyze, and organize this data at
scale, job seekers could identify the keywords they're missing -- and
improve their chances of landing interviews.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Tech Stack

To bring this idea to life, I had to step outside my primary comfort
zone as a backend developer. The project demanded an end-to-end
solution, and here's how I built it:

-   **Data Collection:**\
    I created a **crawler** that scrapes multiple job portals, fetching
    data across different technologies, roles, experiences, and
    locations. This was the foundation -- a large and varied dataset.

-   **Machine Learning Analysis:**\
    Using **N-gram analysis**, I identified the most frequently
    occurring words and phrases in job descriptions. This helped me
    extract skills and categorize them into three major buckets:

    1.  **Technical skills** -- e.g., Java, Android, ReactJS, Scala,
        C++\
    2.  **Interpersonal skills** -- e.g., leadership, communication,
        problem-solving\
    3.  **Other contextual skills** -- e.g., domain knowledge,
        certifications

-   **Backend Service:**\
    I designed a backend service to expose this processed data via REST
    APIs. To ensure speed and scalability, I implemented caching
    mechanisms so that frequently accessed skill data didn't require
    recomputation. This backend became the "brain" of the system.

-   **Frontend UI:**\
    I built a **React.js web application** that consumed the backend
    APIs. The UI presented the data visually as **word clouds**, making
    it easy to see which skills dominate the job market. It also
    separated skills by category (e.g., Android, Java, JavaScript, iOS,
    Scala, C++), so users could filter and focus on what mattered most.

-   **Resume Analysis Tool:**\
    Perhaps the most impactful feature: job seekers could **upload their
    resumes** and the system would analyze them against the dataset. It
    highlighted the **top missing keywords** for their specific profile
    -- essentially telling users what their resumes lacked compared to
    industry demand.

-   **Hosting & Deployment:**\
    The entire solution was hosted on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
    for reliability and scalability. This included the backend service,
    the frontend React application, and the machine learning analysis
    workflows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Repositories

For transparency and reproducibility, I made the source code available
on GitHub:

-   **Frontend (React.js):**
    [profile_keywords](https://github.com/dkulsh/profile_keywords)\
-   **Backend (REST APIs):**
    [KeywordsBackend](https://github.com/dkulsh/KeywordsBackend)\
-   **ML Analysis (N-gram + skill extraction):**
    [wordcount_analysis](https://github.com/dkulsh/wordcount_analysis)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Challenges and Upskilling

While I've been primarily a **backend developer**, this project pushed
me into areas I had less experience with:

-   **Machine Learning:** Building and refining the N-gram analysis
    pipeline required me to quickly upskill on natural language
    processing basics.\
-   **Frontend Development:** Creating a polished UI in React.js meant
    learning component-based design, state management, and integrating
    with REST APIs.\
-   **System Design:** Ensuring smooth integration between the crawler,
    ML analysis, backend APIs, and frontend UI involved thoughtful
    architectural decisions.\
-   **Cloud Hosting:** Deploying the entire system on GCP involved
    setting up services, networking, and handling scalability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why This Matters

This project wasn't just an academic exercise -- it solves a real pain
point. By bridging job market data with resume optimization, it empowers
candidates to present themselves better to hiring algorithms. The end
result: more deserving candidates get noticed.

For me, the journey was just as important. I expanded my skills from
pure backend work to cover **ML pipelines, frontend engineering, and
cloud deployment**. It was a complete end-to-end build, and I'm proud to
showcase it as part of my portfolio.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

This project reflects how I approach challenges: by diving into new
areas, learning quickly, and delivering working, integrated solutions.
It combines multiple disciplines -- **data crawling, NLP, backend
engineering, caching strategies, UI/UX, and cloud deployment** -- into a
cohesive system that can make a difference in real-world job hunting.
